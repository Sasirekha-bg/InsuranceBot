So picking out the best health insurance plans can be challenging.\nThis is why we put together this list to help you shortlist the best\nhealth insurance policies\nin India for 2025.\nBest Health Insurance Plans in India 2025\nTop Health Plans\nInsurer Rating\nFeature Rating\nAffordability\nFinal Rating\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n4.5\n4.5\n3.5\n4.2\nCare Supreme\n3.5\n4.5\n4.8\n4\nNiva Bupa Reassure 2.0\n3.2\n4.8\n4.8\n3.8\nAditya Birla Activ Fit\n3.8\n3.5\n4.6\n3.8\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\n4\n3\n4\n3.8\nHeads Up:\nIt takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyse a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision. This is why we propose a better alternative - taking a 30-minute FREE consultation with Dittoâs certified advisors.\nWe have a spam-free guarantee, and weâll never push you to buy a plan. Donât delay this - we have limited slots every day, so\nbook a quick call here\nbefore they run out.\nLimited slots! Book today!\nOur Methodology\nIf youâre new to insurance, we highly recommend you check out our\nHealth Insurance guide for beginners\n.\nNow, we compiled this list using two broad criteria.\nThe first one is our assessment of the insurance company marketing a given policy. Any company can float a health insurance plan whose\nfeatures\nlook amazing on paper. But if customers have trouble buying the policy, making a claim, or resolving issues, then ultimately the product features donât count for much. So weâve taken into consideration several operational and financial metrics, like claim settlement numbers, track record, and solvency ratios to rank every health insurance company in India.\nWe then took each product and\ncompared\ntheir features. Now bear in mind that most insurance companies will have a basic affordable product, a comprehensive product, and a premium product. The basic product doesnât offer a lot of protection. And the premium products are too expensive and have features that often donât add a lot of value for most people. So while compiling this list weâve only considered comprehensive products that offer significant protection while not burning a hole in your pocket.\nWith that introduction out of the way, letâs look at the top health insurance plans in a little more detail.\nBest Health Insurance Plans\n1\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure Health Insurance\nHDFC Ergo\nOptima Secure takes the top rank this year. It was introduced to replace the companyâs best-selling product -\nOptima Restore\n. In just 2 years since its launch, it has done just that â exceeding expectations from all corners and emerging as our top recommendation for the best health insurance plan for the year 2024.\nInsurer Rating\n4.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n3.5\nFinal Rating\n4.2\nWhy\nOptima Secure\nis our top recommendation\nOptima Secure is an extremely comprehensive policy. It has no room rent restrictions, no\nco-pay clause\n, covers\nAyush treatments\nand has reasonable\nwaiting periods\nfor\npre-existing diseases\n. It also has a bunch of industry-first features that will excite a lot of people.\nSecure Benefit:\nSecure benefit instantly doubles your cover the moment you buy the policy. So for instance, if you buy a a policy with a sum insured of â¹10 lakhs, you get the â¹10 lakhs as base cover and an additional â¹10 lakhs as âSecureâ benefit. Effectively you get double the cover without having to pay more.\nProtect Benefit:\nUsually, insurers donât cover non-medical expenses that could include things like bandages, syringes, gloves, and masks. Even if they do cover it, they ask you to pay extra. But Optima Secure covers these expenses at no additional cost.\nPlus Benefit:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, Optima Secure has completely remodeled the bonus feature and is now offering 50% bonus cover every year irrespective of whether you made a claim. The bonus could go as high as 100% if you renew your policy for 2 consecutive years.\nOn a stand-alone basis, these features may not mean much. But when you compare it against Optima Restore, youâll see why this is a huge leap.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE! Book a call now. Limited slots available.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nOptima Restore\nOptima Secure\nSecure Benefit:\nInstant doubling of cover\nProtect Benefit:\nCover for non-medical expenses\nPlus Benefit:\nBonus cover of 50% every year irrespective of whether you make a claim\nAutomatic Restore:\nYour base cover restores in full every time you make a claim\nOptima Secure also comes from HDFC Ergoâs stable, an insurer whose\nclaim settlement\nnumbers and track record are pretty robust.\nRead our full comparison report of\nHDFC Ergo Optima Restore vs HDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nWhile the premiums may be reasonable for some profiles, Optima Secure is generally more expensive when compared to similar plans on the market. So if affordability is a concern, itâs best to look at other plans on this list.\n2\nCare Supreme Health Insurance\nCare\nSupreme is second on our list as it is now the best-selling health insurance policy within Careâs stable. The company launched this plan to compete against the likes of HDFC Ergoâs Optima Secure and Niva Bupaâs Reassure. And considering the features on board and the price point at which it sells, Care Supreme can be a very attractive option for a lot of people.\nInsurer Rating\n3.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n4\nWhy\nCare Supreme\nis No.2 on our list\nItâs a comprehensive plan, that offers pretty much every\nhealth insurance add-ons\nyou need, and it is perhaps one of the most affordable plans in this category. Some of the top features include:\nUnlimited Automatic Restoration\n:\nCare Supreme will automatically refill your cover every time you make a claim. So if you have a policy with a cover of â¹10 lakhs and you make a claim totalling â¹2 lakhs, it will restore your cover back to â¹10 lakhs the moment you make the claim.\nNo Bonus clawbacks:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, they will usually clawback a part of the bonus if you ever make a claim. Care Supreme however has no such clause and you will have your bonus intact even if you make multiple claims.\nAffordability:\nThis isnât a feature as much. But itâs still worth noting that the difference in price point between Care Supreme and other similar plans is substantial. For instance, Optima Secure (our top recommendation) is nearly 30% more expensive when compared to Care Supreme for the profiles listed below.\nPremium comparison\nOptima Secure\nCare Supreme\nMale 28, living in Bangalore\nâ¹12,892\nâ¹7,701\nFamily of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹24,418\nâ¹14,357\nCouple of an advanced age -\nMale 66, Female 63\nNA\nâ¹62,210\nRead our full comparison report of\nCare Supreme vs HDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThere is a 4-year waiting period for pre-existing diseases and the only way to cut this down is to buy separate add-ons. Thereâs also another insurer-specific reason why we arenât ranking this plan higher. The claim settlement and complaint numbers for Care arenât that amazing.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE!

Also, Reassure 2.0 builds on the success of Reassure by offering 3 variants of the same plan with extremely comprehensive features at very competitive price points. For the purpose of this list, we are considering the Platinum variant of Reassure 2.0 which sits right between the\nBronze\nvariant and the\nTitanium\nvariant.\nInsurer Rating\n3.2\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.8\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Reassure 2.0 is third on our list\nIt is one of the best policies in its class. It's economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits at a very attractive price point. Hereâs a select few features that we like:\nForever\nRestoration\n:\nYour cover is restored in full the moment you make a claim. And you will have the extra cover throughout your policy term. Also, the restored sum will be added on top of your existing cover and you can claim the full amount (what's left of your base cover and the restored sum) while making a claim.\nAge lock benefit:\nYour premiums will not increase until you make a claim. However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nCarry Forward Bonus:\nEvery year the policy will calculate the unutilized base cover and transfer it to the next year. So if you started with â¹10 lakhs and you made a claim totaling â¹2 lakhs, the remaining â¹8 lakhs will be added to your cover next year and you will have â¹18 lakhs (â¹10 lakhs base cover + â¹8 Lakhs unutilized base cover + bonus) for the next year.\nReassure\nReassure 2.0\nForever Restoration\nAge Lock Benefit\nCarry Forward Bonus\nPremiums for Family of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹21,306\nâ¹19,560\nRead our full comparison report of\nNiva Bupa ReAssure vs Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThereâs nothing to complain about the features. But there are a few issues with the insurer. After the change in management (Max Bupa to Niva Bupa), we have seen a general rise in the amount of complaints. Our own experience working with the insurer on the claim settlement process has left us a bit frustrated. So we canât possibly place them any higher despite the attractive price point and the industry-first features on hand.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE! Book a call now. Limited slots available.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\n4\nAditya Birla Activ Fit Health Insurance\nAditya Birla\nmakes our list at number 4 because most people we tend to fall between the ages of 18 and 45. And this policy is designed specifically for them. It offers significant discounts if youâre healthy, it has no outrageous restrictions, a very good restoration benefit, supercharged bonus feature and it sells at a very attractive price point.\nInsurer Rating\n3.8\nProduct Feature Rating\n3.5\nAffordability\n4.6\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Aditya Birla Activ Fit takes the 4th spot\nAs we noted already itâs a comprehensive policy and it offers some very nice benefits for people who keep healthy:\nUpfront good health discount:\nYou get an upfront 10% discount on your first policy premium by simply undergoing a successful health assessment.\n100% Binge Refill:\nYour cover will be restored in full every time you make a claim. It offers unlimited restoration.\nMaternity and OPD Coverage:\nYou also get some coverage for\nmaternity-related expenses\nand\noutpatient consultations\n. And while we donât usually recommend these features (since it can burn a hole in your pocket), Aditya Bira offers all of this and more without asking you to pay a bomb.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nWhile the product features are decent and the insurer does okay on most fronts, the maximum entry age for the product is capped at 45 years. So if youâre older than 45 you canât buy this policy, which could be frustrating for those who are above the ages of 45.\n5\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\nBajaj Allianz\nHealth Guard Gold makes our list at no 5. The plan does what you would expect from a comprehensive health policy. Itâs not very expensive. And Bajaj Allianz has been posting very respectable claim settlement numbers so far. All things considered, this is a solid plan from a solid company.\nInsurer Rating\n4\nProduct Feature Rating\n3\nAffordability\n4\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\ntakes the 5th spot\nAs we noted earlier, itâs important to look at product features. But itâs even more important to evaluate the insurer. And when we compare Bajaj Allianzâs claim settlement numbers over the last 3 years against other insurers on this list, you will see why this is one of our top 5 recommendations.\nClaim Settlement Ratios\nBajaj Allianz\nAditya Birla\nCare\nHDFC Ergo\nNiva Bupa\n2020-2021\n94.5%\n89.3%\n95.2%\n97%\n90.7%\n2021-2022\n90.8%\n93.7%\n87%\n100%\n90.8%\n2022-2023\n96.8%\n95.9%\n90%\n95.5%\n90.5%\n2023-2024\n95%\n95%\n90%\n98%\n91%\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nAll the other products that make our list offer significant protection by way of extending features like unlimited restoration, supercharged bonus features and unique benefits that you may not find anywhere else. The problem with Health Guard Gold is that it does what you expect it do, but there arenât any shiny features to boast of. So that should explain why we didnât place the plan higher on the list.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, weâve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

Its economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits including forever restoration (as described below), a better bonus cover package and age-lock feature (as described below once again). Unfortunately, the aggressive pricing means that Niva Bupa has the tough task of paying out ever larger claims while also managing to keep prices low. Can they do it? We don't know.\nPolicy Wording\nView Policy Brochure\nWhat's good here?\nð\nSpecial Mention\nAge Lock Benefit\nYour premiums will not increase until you make a claim. However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nYour premiums will not increase until you make a claim. However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nYouâll never have to split the bill\nThe insurer will bear the entire cost of treatment (up to the sum insured). You wonât have to pay a single penny. Meaning this policy has no co-payment.\nLearn More\nYou always have full cover irrespective of the disease\nNo funny business here. If your insurer hasnât explicitly stated they wonât cover a certain illness, you can claim the full amount up to the sum insured, irrespective of the disease youâre dealing with. Meaning this policy doesn't impose the dreaded disease wise sub-limits.\nLearn More\nUnlimited Restoration Benefit\nEven after you claim part of the cover on one occasion, you will be allowed to claim the full cover any number of times repeatedly if you are hospitalized in the future. All in the same year by the way!!!\nLearn More\nCarry forward your unutilized cover\nEvery year the policy will calculate the unutilized base cover and transfer it to the next year. So if you started with 10 lakhs and you made a claim totaling 2 lakhs, the remaining 8 lakhs will be added to your cover next year and you will have 18 lakhs (10 lakhs base cover + 8 Lakhs unutilized base cover as bonus) for the next year. This will continue until your cover totals 6x the base sum insured(carry forward unutilized cover up to 5x of base cover).\nLearn More\nFull coverage even if you are forced to hospitalize at home\nThe insurer will bear the costs even if you are hospitalized at home due to a condition or the hospital running out of beds. In insurance lingo, they call this a policy with domiciliary cover.\nLearn More\nYou can pick any room you like\nShared room, single room, deluxe room or any room thatâs available. The insurer wonât nitpick on your choice of room since the policy has no restrictions on room rent.\nLearn More\nPre & Post hospitalization expenses covered\nNo worries if the doctor had to run a host of diagnostic tests before or after hospitalizing you. The insurer has your back. They will cover this amount in full for a pretty reasonable duration -\n60\ndays before you are hospitalized and\n180\ndays after discharge. This includes the cost of medication by the way.\nLearn More\nDay Care treatments covered\nIf youâre hospitalized for less than 24 hours in lieu of a minor procedure, then the insurer will cover these costs too. Think dialysis, chemotherapy or minor surgeries.\nLearn More\nFree Health Checkups\nAvailable from day-1, 500 for every 1L sum insured. Max of 5000 rupees for an individual policy and up-to 10000 in a floater policy\nLearn More\nCovers Alternative Medicine\nThink of getting Ayurvedic, Homeopathic or other alternative treatments to cure an illness? Your insurer will cover you fully, up to the sum insured.\nLearn More\nWhat's okay here?\nReasonable waiting period for pre-existing diseases\nIf youâre already dealing with diabetes, cardiovascular problems or any such illnesses, the insurer will cover all costs arising out of these pre-existing problems after you wait for 3 years.\nLearn More\nIf youâre already dealing with diabetes, cardiovascular problems or any such illnesses, the insurer will cover all costs arising out of these pre-existing problems after you wait for 3 years.\nLearn More\nAdd-on\ns\nDisease Management\nThis add-on will cut waiting periods to 0 days for the following pre-existing conditions: Hypertension and Diabetes. And if you are currently diagnosed with any of these conditions, it makes sense to opt for this add-on.\nSafeguard +\nWith this add-on, the insurer will increase your cover in line with inflation every year, your bonus amount will not be affected if the claim is less than 1 Lakh in the entire year and you also get extended coverage for generally excluded items like syringes, gloves, PPE kits etc.\nHospital Cash\nWith this add-on, the insurer will hand out Rs. 1000/day, Rs. 2000/day or Rs. 4000/day in cash every day you stay at the hospital subject to certain limits. The cash is expected to replace your income during the course of your hospitalization.\nAggregate Deductible\nIf you ever have to make a claim, then youâll be expected to pay a sum before insurance company settles the claim. This amount is called the deductible. So if you want to buy a policy at a better price, you can opt to pay a higher deductible i.e. you can pay lower premiums by offering to pay a sum (a deductible) when a claim comes up.\nSafeguard\nWith this add-on, the insurer will increase your cover in line with inflation every year, your bonus amount will not be affected if the claim is less than â¹50,000 in the entire year and you also get extended coverage for generally excluded items like syringes, gloves, PPE kits etc.\nAcute Care\nWith this add-on, you get unlimited tele-consultations with Doctors (General Medical Practitioners, Specialists & Super Specialists) along with coverage for pharmacy and diagnostics up to a certain limit.\nPersonal Accident cover\nWith this add-on, the insurance company will payout a lumpsum of 5x your sum insured, in case the proposer of the policy passes away in an accident. The payout will be made subject to a cap of 1CR in total.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ have waiting periods?\nYes. ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ imposes 3 kinds of waiting periods -\n30-Day Waiting Period:\nHospitalizations wonât be covered for the first 30 days of the policy unless itâs an accident.\nSpecific Illness Waiting Period:\nThereâs a 2-year waiting period for a list of diseases which is a mandate before you can start claiming.\nPre-Existing Disease Waiting Period:\nThere's a 3-year waiting period for any pre-existing disease you may have while buying the policy.\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ have room rent restrictions?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ offer a restoration benefit?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ cover AYUSH treatments?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ offer a bonus?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ offer maternity benefits?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ offer international coverage?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ offer dental protection?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ offer coverage for outpatient consultations?\nHow are the premiums calculated for ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+?\nCan I avail myself of a discount on ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ have entry and exit restrictions?\nHow do you file a claim if you have ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+?\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

It was introduced to replace the companyâs best-selling product -\nOptima Restore\n.

It also has a bunch of industry-first features that will excite a lot of people.\nSecure Benefit:\nSecure benefit instantly doubles your cover the moment you buy the policy. So for instance, if you buy a a policy with a sum insured of â¹10 lakhs, you get the â¹10 lakhs as base cover and an additional â¹10 lakhs as âSecureâ benefit. Effectively you get double the cover without having to pay more.\nProtect Benefit:\nUsually, insurers donât cover non-medical expenses that could include things like bandages, syringes, gloves, and masks. Even if they do cover it, they ask you to pay extra. But Optima Secure covers these expenses at no additional cost.\nPlus Benefit:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, Optima Secure has completely remodeled the bonus feature and is now offering 50% bonus cover every year irrespective of whether you made a claim. The bonus could go as high as 100% if you renew your policy for 2 consecutive years.\nOn a stand-alone basis, these features may not mean much. But when you compare it against Optima Restore, youâll see why this is a huge leap.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

So if affordability is a concern, itâs best to look at other plans on this list.\n2\nCare Supreme Health Insurance\nCare\nSupreme is second on our list as it is now the best-selling health insurance policy within Careâs stable. The company launched this plan to compete against the likes of HDFC Ergoâs Optima Secure and Niva Bupaâs Reassure. And considering the features on board and the price point at which it sells, Care Supreme can be a very attractive option for a lot of people.\nInsurer Rating\n3.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n4\nWhy\nCare Supreme\nis No.2 on our list\nItâs a comprehensive plan, that offers pretty much every\nhealth insurance add-ons\nyou need, and it is perhaps one of the most affordable plans in this category. Some of the top features include:\nUnlimited Automatic Restoration\n:\nCare Supreme will automatically refill your cover every time you make a claim. So if you have a policy with a cover of â¹10 lakhs and you make a claim totalling â¹2 lakhs, it will restore your cover back to â¹10 lakhs the moment you make the claim.\nNo Bonus clawbacks:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, they will usually clawback a part of the bonus if you ever make a claim. Care Supreme however has no such clause and you will have your bonus intact even if you make multiple claims.\nAffordability:\nThis isnât a feature as much. But itâs still worth noting that the difference in price point between Care Supreme and other similar plans is substantial. For instance, Optima Secure (our top recommendation) is nearly 30% more expensive when compared to Care Supreme for the profiles listed below.\nPremium comparison\nOptima Secure\nCare Supreme\nMale 28, living in Bangalore\nâ¹12,892\nâ¹7,701\nFamily of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹24,418\nâ¹14,357\nCouple of an advanced age -\nMale 66, Female 63\nNA\nâ¹62,210\nRead our full comparison report of\nCare Supreme vs HDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThere is a 4-year waiting period for pre-existing diseases and the only way to cut this down is to buy separate add-ons. Thereâs also another insurer-specific reason why we arenât ranking this plan higher. The claim settlement and complaint numbers for Care arenât that amazing.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE!

Also, Reassure 2.0 builds on the success of Reassure by offering 3 variants of the same plan with extremely comprehensive features at very competitive price points. For the purpose of this list, we are considering the Platinum variant of Reassure 2.0 which sits right between the\nBronze\nvariant and the\nTitanium\nvariant.\nInsurer Rating\n3.2\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.8\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Reassure 2.0 is third on our list\nIt is one of the best policies in its class. It's economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits at a very attractive price point. Hereâs a select few features that we like:\nForever\nRestoration\n:\nYour cover is restored in full the moment you make a claim. And you will have the extra cover throughout your policy term. Also, the restored sum will be added on top of your existing cover and you can claim the full amount (what's left of your base cover and the restored sum) while making a claim.\nAge lock benefit:\nYour premiums will not increase until you make a claim. However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nCarry Forward Bonus:\nEvery year the policy will calculate the unutilized base cover and transfer it to the next year. So if you started with â¹10 lakhs and you made a claim totaling â¹2 lakhs, the remaining â¹8 lakhs will be added to your cover next year and you will have â¹18 lakhs (â¹10 lakhs base cover + â¹8 Lakhs unutilized base cover + bonus) for the next year.\nReassure\nReassure 2.0\nForever Restoration\nAge Lock Benefit\nCarry Forward Bonus\nPremiums for Family of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹21,306\nâ¹19,560\nRead our full comparison report of\nNiva Bupa ReAssure vs Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThereâs nothing to complain about the features. But there are a few issues with the insurer. After the change in management (Max Bupa to Niva Bupa), we have seen a general rise in the amount of complaints. Our own experience working with the insurer on the claim settlement process has left us a bit frustrated. So we canât possibly place them any higher despite the attractive price point and the industry-first features on hand.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

Limited slots available.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\n4\nAditya Birla Activ Fit Health Insurance\nAditya Birla\nmakes our list at number 4 because most people we tend to fall between the ages of 18 and 45. And this policy is designed specifically for them. It offers significant discounts if youâre healthy, it has no outrageous restrictions, a very good restoration benefit, supercharged bonus feature and it sells at a very attractive price point.\nInsurer Rating\n3.8\nProduct Feature Rating\n3.5\nAffordability\n4.6\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Aditya Birla Activ Fit takes the 4th spot\nAs we noted already itâs a comprehensive policy and it offers some very nice benefits for people who keep healthy:\nUpfront good health discount:\nYou get an upfront 10% discount on your first policy premium by simply undergoing a successful health assessment.\n100% Binge Refill:\nYour cover will be restored in full every time you make a claim. It offers unlimited restoration.\nMaternity and OPD Coverage:\nYou also get some coverage for\nmaternity-related expenses\nand\noutpatient consultations\n. And while we donât usually recommend these features (since it can burn a hole in your pocket), Aditya Bira offers all of this and more without asking you to pay a bomb.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nWhile the product features are decent and the insurer does okay on most fronts, the maximum entry age for the product is capped at 45 years. So if youâre older than 45 you canât buy this policy, which could be frustrating for those who are above the ages of 45.\n5\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\nBajaj Allianz\nHealth Guard Gold makes our list at no 5. The plan does what you would expect from a comprehensive health policy. Itâs not very expensive. And Bajaj Allianz has been posting very respectable claim settlement numbers so far. All things considered, this is a solid plan from a solid company.\nInsurer Rating\n4\nProduct Feature Rating\n3\nAffordability\n4\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\ntakes the 5th spot\nAs we noted earlier, itâs important to look at product features. But itâs even more important to evaluate the insurer. And when we compare Bajaj Allianzâs claim settlement numbers over the last 3 years against other insurers on this list, you will see why this is one of our top 5 recommendations.\nClaim Settlement Ratios\nBajaj Allianz\nAditya Birla\nCare\nHDFC Ergo\nNiva Bupa\n2020-2021\n94.5%\n89.3%\n95.2%\n97%\n90.7%\n2021-2022\n90.8%\n93.7%\n87%\n100%\n90.8%\n2022-2023\n96.8%\n95.9%\n90%\n95.5%\n90.5%\n2023-2024\n95%\n95%\n90%\n98%\n91%\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nAll the other products that make our list offer significant protection by way of extending features like unlimited restoration, supercharged bonus features and unique benefits that you may not find anywhere else. The problem with Health Guard Gold is that it does what you expect it do, but there arenât any shiny features to boast of. So that should explain why we didnât place the plan higher on the list.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, weâve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

It covers a bunch of OPD treatments, includes a critical illness rider and extends some protection for maternity expenses. If youâre looking for a plan that offers coverage for outpatient consultations, this could be a decent choice. However, ICICI Lombardâs claim settlement ratio is less than desirable and this is something you should keep in mind.\nPolicy Wording\nView Policy Brochure\nWhat's good here?\nYouâll never have to split the bill\nThe insurer will bear the entire cost of treatment (up to the sum insured). You wonât have to pay a single penny. Meaning this policy has no co-payment.\nLearn More\nThe insurer will bear the entire cost of treatment (up to the sum insured). You wonât have to pay a single penny. Meaning this policy has no co-payment.\nLearn More\nYou can pick any room you like\nShared room, single room, deluxe room or any room thatâs available. The insurer wonât nitpick on your choice of room since the policy has no restrictions on room rent.\nLearn More\nShort waiting period for Pre Existing Diseases\nIf youâre already dealing with diabetes, cardiovascular problems or any such illnesses, the insurer will cover all costs arising out of these pre-existing problems after just 2 years. Itâs probably the best deal you can get to be honest.\nLearn More\nGood Restoration Benefit\nEven after you claim part of the cover on one occasion, you will have 100% of the cover restored, so that you can use this benefit in the event you have to endure multiple hospitalizations.\nLearn More\nSpecial Bonus for being healthy\nYour sum insured increases by 20% each year, even if you've claimed in the previous year. But before you get too ahead of yourself, do note that theyâll stop offering you the bonus when your sum insured increases by 100%. But hey, it's still a bonus.\nLearn More\nFull coverage even if you are forced to hospitalize at home\nThe insurer will bear the costs even if you are hospitalized at home due to a condition or the hospital running out of beds. In insurance lingo, they call this a policy with domiciliary cover.\nLearn More\nYou always have full cover irrespective of the disease\nNo funny business here. If your insurer hasnât explicitly stated they wonât cover a certain illness, you can claim the full amount up to the sum insured, irrespective of the disease youâre dealing with. Meaning this policy doesn't impose the dreaded disease wise sub-limits.\nLearn More\nPre & Post hospitalization expenses covered\nNo worries if the doctor had to run a host of diagnostic tests before or after hospitalizing you. The insurer has your back. They will cover this amount in full for a pretty reasonable duration -\n60\ndays before you are hospitalized and\n180\ndays after discharge. This includes the cost of medication by the way.\nLearn More\nDay Care treatments covered\nIf youâre hospitalized for less than 24 hours in lieu of a minor procedure, then the insurer will cover these costs too. Think dialysis, chemotherapy or minor surgeries.\nLearn More\nFree Health Checkups every  year\nIf youâre planning on getting a full body checkup every   year just to make sure youâre in fine working condition, the insurer will cover the costs.\nLearn More\nCovers Alternative Medicine\nThink of getting Ayurvedic, Homeopathic or other alternative treatments to cure an illness? Your insurer will cover you fully, up to the sum insured.\nLearn More\nAdd-on\ns\nSum Insured Protector\nWith this add-on, the insurer will increase your cover in line with inflation every year.\nAnnual Health Check-ups\nWith this add-on, you get free health checkups every year subject to certain limits and tests prescribed in the policy document. However you can only claim this on a cashless basis at one of the network hospitals.\nMaternity\nWith this add-on, you get added coverage for maternity expenses i.e. childbirth . However, the coverage is limited to 10% of the base sum insured maximum up to â¹1 Lakh with Maternity Waiting Period of 9 months (if the plan is taken for 3 years in a single shot).\nCritical Illness\nWith this add-on you get a lumpsum payment in the event you are diagnosed with critical illnesses outlined in the policy document.\nClaim Protector\nWith this add-on, you also get extended coverage for generally excluded items like syringes, gloves, PPE kits etc.\nBeFit cover\nWith this add on, you can get coverage for outpatient and e-consultations i.e. doctor visits.\nHospital Cash\nWith this add-on, the insurer will hand out cash every day you stay at the hospital subject to certain limits. The cash is expected to replace your income during the course of your hospitalization.\nPersonal Accident cover\nWith this add-on, the insurance company will payout a lumpsum of 100% your sum insured, in case the proposer of the policy passes away in an accident. The payout will be made subject to a cap of 50 lakh in total.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDoes Health AdvantEdge have waiting periods?\nYes. Health AdvantEdge imposes 3 kinds of waiting periods -\n30-Day Waiting Period:\nHospitalizations wonât be covered for the first 30 days of the policy unless itâs an accident.\nSpecific Illness Waiting Period:\nThereâs a 2-year waiting period for a list of diseases which is a mandate before you can start claiming.\nPre-Existing Disease Waiting Period:\nThere's a 2-year waiting period for any pre-existing disease you may have while buying the policy.\nDoes Health AdvantEdge have room rent restrictions?\nDoes Health AdvantEdge offer a restoration benefit?\nDoes Health AdvantEdge cover AYUSH treatments?\nDoes Health AdvantEdge offer a bonus?\nDoes Health AdvantEdge offer maternity benefits?\nDoes Health AdvantEdge offer international coverage?\nDoes Health AdvantEdge offer dental protection?\nDoes Health AdvantEdge offer coverage for outpatient consultations?\nHow are the premiums calculated for Health AdvantEdge?\nCan I avail myself of a discount on Health AdvantEdge?\nDoes Health AdvantEdge have entry and exit restrictions?\nHow do you file a claim if you have Health AdvantEdge?\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

Founded in 2001, the company offers various health, travel, motor, and other general insurance products. It has health insurance products tailor made for individuals, senior citizens, families, and international travelers. It's health insurance has a network of cashless hospitals, an in-house health administration team. It provides 60mins claim settlements. It offers health insurance policies with life time renewability.\nClaim Settlement Ratio -Â\n95\n%Â\nÂ (average of last 3 years)\nNetwork Hospitals -\n12,000+\nBajaj Allianz Health insurance plans\n1\nExtra Care Top-up\nWhile it is a decent top up plan, it only allows you to pick a maximum cover of 15 lakhs. So if you're ever hospitalized for a complicated condition, then the cover might not suffice. More importantly in our opinion, it is never a good idea to buy a top up policy in the first place. Always choose a super to up plan and if you want to why, click here.\nView Policy\n3\nHealth Care Supreme Smart\nHealth Care Supreme Smart is a great policy. It covers most bases. It doesn't have any outrageous conditions. It doesn't make you wait too long before covering pre-existing diseases. And it even offers you adequate cover for outpatient consultations. The only caveat is that it's a fairly expensive policy and we wouldn't fault you if you sought other alternatives.\nView Policy\n5\nHealth Care Supreme Vital\nHealth Care Supreme Vital is a great policy. It covers most bases. It doesn't have any outrageous conditions. It doesn't make you wait too long before covering pre-existing diseases. And it even offers you some cover for outpatient consultations. The only caveat is that it's a fairly expensive policy and we wouldn't fault you if you sought other alternatives.\nView Policy\n7\nSilver Health\nBajaj Allianz Silver Health is a decent policy if you're 46 and above. And while they only make you wait 1 year before covering complications arising out of pre-existing diseases(like diabetes), you will have to bear 50% of the costs in such cases. And it's not exactly cheap either. So maybe you could look at other alternatives?\nView Policy\n9\nExtra Care Plus Super Top-up\nExtra Care Plus (Super Top-up) is an excellent option. It doesn't have any restrictions on the kind of room you can pick. It offers you the luxury of topping up your base cover by about 50 lakhs and it even offer maternity benefits after 1 year of buying the policy. All in all, one of the best super top up plan out there.\nView Policy\n2\nHealth Ensure Family Plan\nIt's a decent policy for your family and if any of you have pre-existing diseases (like diabetes), you can rest easy knowing that they'll cover complications arising out of these complications only after 2 years. But the policy does have a few unsavory conditions including limits on room rent. So you might want to read more.\nView Policy\n4\nHealth Care Supreme Ultimo\nHealth Care Supreme is a great policy. It covers most bases. It doesn't have any outrageous conditions. It doesn't make you wait too long before covering pre-existing diseases. And it even offers you more than adequate cover for outpatient consultations. The only caveat is that it's a fairly expensive policy and we wouldn't fault you if you sought other alternatives.\nView Policy\n6\nHealth Guard Gold\nHealth-Guard Gold is a pretty good policy. It covers most bases. It doesn't include outrageous conditions. It offers a whole host of benefits including coverage for maternity (after 6 years of buying the policy, of course). And it isn't pricey either. A solid pick overall.\nView Policy\n8\nHealth Guard Platinum\nHealth-Guard Platinum is definitely pricey. But it offers a whole host of benefits. It covers most bases. It doesn't include outrageous conditions. And it includes coverage for maternity (after 6 years of buying the policy, of course). So you definitely get a lot at this price, but maybe consider health guard gold before you lock this one?\nView Policy\n10\nHealth Guard Silver\nHealth Guard Silver is a decent policy and is definitely an economical option. But with a low cover (less than 2 lakhs) and restrictions on the kind of rooms you can pick, maybe you ought to consider other options. Health-Guard Gold perhaps?\nView Policy\nBajaj Allianz Health insurance claim process\nBajaj Allianz\nclaims can be of different types based on the hospital in which you are getting the treatment. If itâs part of\nBajaj Allianz\n's network hospitals, you can get a âCashless claimâ in which insurance company directly pays the bills to the hospital. But if your choice of hospital is not part of their network, then you have to pay the bills and apply for reimbursement claim. Hereâs a brief process for both types of claims:\nCashless Claims\n1\nInform the Hospital Desk\nAll network hospitals have an insurance desk. You can submit your policy copy (even soft copy works), ID proof, initial diagnosis report and the insurance desk will request the insurance company for âpre-authorizationâ. In case of planned treatments, you need to do this process 2 days before hospitalization\n2\nInsurerâs decision\nBased on the provided documents, insurance company approve the claim and the hospital will start the treatment and they will co-ordinate with insurer for the treatment costs. In case of Cashless claim rejection, you can still go ahead with the treatment. In this case, you will need to pay the bills initially and can file for a reimbursement claim later\n3\nDischarge\nIf your cashless claim is approved, at the time of discharge, the insurance company will do the final settlement with the hospital and once that is sorted, you are good to go.\nReimbursement Claims\n1\nInform the insurance company\nFor any planned treatments, you need to inform the insurance company 2 days before hospitalisation. In case of emergency, you can inform within 24 hours of admission. Insurance company will acknowledge the intimation.\n2\nHospitalization\nYou need to submit a insurance claim form along with original copies of hospital bills, doctor consultation reports, and diagonstic reports.\n3\nFile the claim\nWithin 30 days post discharge, you can initiate the claim online or at any of the registered offices of the insurance company. You need to fill a claim form and attach all the reports and bills.\n4\nInsurerâs decision\nBased on the claim form and submitted documents, insurance company will settle the claims as per policy terms and conditions.\nBajaj Allianz Health Insurance Renewal\nFirstly, if youâve purchased the policy online, youâll always receive an intimation e-mail from the insurer around 30 days before the renewal date. The e-mail will have a renewal link that will directly take you to the page where you can make the payment and check policy details. And itâs done. Youâll receive the policy document via e-mail.\nHowever, in case you choose to do it on your own, hereâs what you need to do:\n1\nVisit the website\nVisit the Bajaj Allianz website and then go to the Renewal section\nhere\n.\n2\nEnter details\nYouâd be asked to provide your current policy number which you can find in the policy soft copy. You may as well be asked to enter your mobile number, email ID, Date of Birth or policy expiry date.\n3\nReview and edit the policy details\nNext, youâll be able to see details of your new policy and the renewal premium you need to pay. Also, youâll be given the option to make some changes related to sum insured, existing covered members, etc.\n4\nComplete the payment and itâs done\nOnce you confirm the details, youâll be directed to the payment gateway. Once the payment is complete, youâll receive your new policy soft copy via e-mail.\nFew things to consider when renewing your Bajaj Allianz health insurance policy\nIf you want to increase your Sum Insured, now is the time. You canât do it anytime during the year.\nIf you didnât make a claim in the past year, make sure you have been given a no-claim bonus if your policy offers it.\nIf you want to add members like your spouse or kids, you have the option to do so only at the time of renewal. So do give this a thought.\nCustomer Reviews\nView All\nNice\nGood service and policy\nsuperb Health Plan\nI got to know about Bajaj Allainz insurance through ad and called them.

So if the bill adds up to Rs. 2,00,000 and the co-payment is set at 20% then you could be asked to pay Rs. 40,000 from the bill. In this case, however, Optima Restore doesnât impose a co-payment clause. And neither does Optima Secure.\nRoom rent\nIf the policy does impose room rent restrictions then the insurer may only let you stay in a room of a certain specification or impose a cap on the total room rent. If you were to breach either criterion then the insurance company may ask you to pay a portion of all the expenses you incurred while staying in the room. In this case, however, Optima Restore doesnât impose any restrictions on the kind of room you can pick. And Optima Secure also doesnât impose any restrictions on this front. You can pick any room you want.\nSub limits\nSome policies will tell you that they will cover all medical expenses up until the sum insured, but then impose caps on the total costs you can incur while dealing with a very specific list of diseases. We call these caps âDisease Wise Sub Limits.â In this case, neither Optima Restore imposes disease-wise sub-limits nor does Optima Secure\nWaiting periods for pre-existing diseases\nIf youâre suffering from a lifestyle condition or if youâve had surgery in the past, or if youâre dealing with an acute or chronic illness at the time of buying the policy, then the insurer may classify this as a pre-existing disease. And they may tell you that they will only cover these illnesses after some time. This cooling period is referred to as the Pre-existing-disease waiting period. In this case, Optima Restore imposes a 3 year waiting period on pre-existing diseases and Optima Secure will similarly tell you to wait 3 years before making a claim related to your pre-existing diseases\nPre and post Hospitalization expenses\nMost people arenât hospitalized right off the bat. Instead, theyâll have to go through a whole series of diagnostic tests before hospitalization and take medication post-discharge. These costs are outlined as pre-hospitalization expenses and post-hospitalization expenses respectively. In this case, Optima Restore covers expenses incurred 60 days before hospitalization and expenses incurred 180 days post-hospitalization. Meanwhile, Optima Secure covers expenses incurred 60 days before hospitalization and expenses incurred 180 after hospitalization, although there may be different sub-limits\nNo claim bonus\nSome policies will tell you that they will incentivize you for not making a claim in any given year. And they offer such incentives by offering extra cover on top of the existing sum insured. This extra cover is categorized as a no-claim bonus. And in this case, Optima Restore offers a no-claim bonus of 50% and Optima Secure similarly extends a 50% no-claim bonus.\nDomiciliary\nImagine you are forced to treat yourself at home because you donât find a hospital bed, or you have a chronic condition that prevents you from visiting one, then, insurers may choose to cover your treatment even if youâre hospitalized at home. And such costs are collectively categorized as domiciliary treatment costs. In this case, however, Optima Restore offers domiciliary cover. And Optima Secure also coves domiciliary expenses.\nAyush treatments\nMost policies only cover treatments administered in a registered medical facility. However, on some occasions, you may want to pursue alternative treatments including homoeopathy, Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. These treatments are collectively categorized as Ayush treatments. And in this case, Optima Restore covers Ayush procedures and Optima Secure also extends coverage for Ayush treatments.\nMaternity benefits\nIf youâre hospitalized during childbirth, then you may have to incur significant costs during delivery of your newborn, child care and other related matters during the course of the hospitalization. These costs are collectively termed maternity costs. And in this case, neither Optima Restore offers maternity cover nor does Optima Secure.\nOut Patient Department (OPD)\nDoctor visits and regular consultations arenât usually covered by health insurance policies. They are categorized as Outpatient consultations (or OPD treatments) and patients have to bear the cost on their own. In this case, however, neither Optima Restore extends coverage for outpatient consultations, nor does Optima Secure.\nFinal Conclusion\nAfter considering all the features on hand, we believe that Optima Secure is a better alternative to Optima Restore for most use cases that weâve evaluated so far.\nOther\nHDFC Ergo Optima Restore\nComparisons\nHDFC Ergo Optima Restore\nvs\nHDFC Ergo Optima Super Secure\nHDFC Ergo Optima Restore\nvs\nMax Bupa Health Premia Gold\nHDFC Ergo Optima Restore\nvs\nNew India Assurance Senior Citizen Mediclaim\nOther\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\nComparisons\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\nvs\nZuno (erstwhile Edelweiss) Health Insurance Gold\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\nvs\nZuno (erstwhile Edelweiss) Health Insurance Platinum\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\nvs\nSBI Arogya Plus\nSelect the best plan with our help!\nGet in touch to find out what plan works best for you.

It covers most bases. It doesn't include outrageous conditions. It offers a whole host of benefits including coverage for maternity (after 6 years of buying the policy, of course). And it isn't pricey either. A solid pick overall.\nPolicy Wording\nView Policy Brochure\nWhat's good here?\nYouâll never have to split the bill\nThe insurer will bear the entire cost of treatment (up to the sum insured). You wonât have to pay a single penny. Meaning this policy has no co-payment.\nLearn More\nThe insurer will bear the entire cost of treatment (up to the sum insured). You wonât have to pay a single penny. Meaning this policy has no co-payment.\nLearn More\nPre & Post hospitalization expenses covered\nNo worries if the doctor had to run a host of diagnostic tests before or after hospitalizing you. The insurer has your back. They will cover this amount in full for a pretty reasonable duration -\n60\ndays before you are hospitalized and\n90\ndays after discharge. This includes the cost of medication by the way.\nLearn More\nCovers Alternative Medicine\nThink of getting Ayurvedic, Homeopathic or other alternative treatments to cure an illness? Your insurer will cover you fully, up to the sum insured.\nLearn More\nDay Care treatments covered\nIf youâre hospitalized for less than 24 hours in lieu of a minor procedure, then the insurer will cover these costs too. Think dialysis, chemotherapy or minor surgeries.\nLearn More\nWhat's bad here?\nYour insurer wonât pay the full bill for certain diseases\nYour insurance cover wonât be fully available in case you are treated for eye related diseases like cataracts, up to 20% of base sum insured max. of â¹1,00,000 will be covered.\nLearn More\nNo coverage if you are forced to hospitalize at home\nThe insurer will not cover the costs if you are forced to hospitalize at home due to a medical condition. In insurance lingo, they call this a policy with no domiciliary cover.\nLearn More\nWhat's okay here?\nYou can pick a Single Private room but nothing fancy\nYou can share a room or you could have a single room for yourself. But if you are looking for anything slightly fancy, be ready to foot a part of the bill.\nLearn More\nYou can share a room or you could have a single room for yourself. But if you are looking for anything slightly fancy, be ready to foot a part of the bill.\nLearn More\nReasonable waiting period for pre-existing diseases\nIf youâre already dealing with diabetes, cardiovascular problems or any such illnesses, the insurer will cover all costs arising out of these pre-existing problems after you wait for 3 years.\nLearn More\nSpecial Bonus for being healthy and not claiming insurance\nYour sum insured increases by 10% each year, so long as you make no claims during this period. But before you get too ahead of yourself, do note that theyâll stop offering you the bonus when your sum insured increases by 100%. Also, the bonus amount will reduce at same rate each time you make a claim. But hey, it's still a bonus.\nLearn More\nMaternity benefits offered\nThe insurer will also cover expenses related to maternityâ Think hospitalization expenses incurred while giving birth. But theyâll only pay upto â¹25,000 and make you wait 6 years before covering this expense. Also, youâll only get the benefits if both, you and your spouse are enrolled in a single-family floater plan.\nLearn More\nGood Restoration Benefit\nOnce you exhaust your entire cover, you will have 100% of the cover restored, if you are hospitalized one more time in a bid to treat a different complication. In the same year, by the way.\nBut remember, this benefit is available once in the policy lifetime for hospitalization related to Cancer & Kidney failure requiring regular dialysis.\nLearn More\nNo free Health Checkups unless you wait 3 years\nIf youâre planning on getting a full body checkup just to make sure youâre in fine working condition, the insurer will cover the cost once in 3 years. However, just so you know, most insurance policies offer free yearly health checkups.\nLearn More\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDoes Health Guard Gold have waiting periods?\nYes. Health Guard Gold imposes 4 kinds of waiting periods -\n30-Day Waiting Period:\nHospitalizations wonât be covered for the first 30 days of the policy unless itâs an accident.\nSpecific Illness Waiting Period:\nThereâs a 2 to 3-year waiting period for a list of diseases which is a mandate before you can start claiming.\nPre-Existing Disease Waiting Period:\nThere's a 3-year waiting period for any pre-existing disease you may have while buying the policy.\nMaternity and Newborn Waiting Period:\nThereâs a 6-year waiting period before you can make claims related to pregnancy and childbirth.\nDoes Health Guard Gold have room rent restrictions?\nDoes Health Guard Gold offer a restoration benefit?\nDoes Health Guard Gold cover AYUSH treatments?\nDoes Health Guard Gold offer a bonus?\nDoes Health Guard Gold offer maternity benefits?\nDoes Health Guard Gold offer international coverage?\nDoes Health Guard Gold offer dental protection?\nDoes Health Guard Gold offer coverage for outpatient consultations?\nHow are the premiums calculated for Health Guard Gold?\nCan I avail myself of a discount on Health Guard Gold?\nDoes Health Guard Gold have entry and exit restrictions?\nHow do you file a claim if you have Health Guard Gold?\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

So picking out the best health insurance plans can be challenging.\nThis is why we put together this list to help you shortlist the best\nhealth insurance policies\nin India for 2025.\nBest Health Insurance Plans in India 2025\nTop Health Plans\nInsurer Rating\nFeature Rating\nAffordability\nFinal Rating\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n4.5\n4.5\n3.5\n4.2\nCare Supreme\n3.5\n4.5\n4.8\n4\nNiva Bupa Reassure 2.0\n3.2\n4.8\n4.8\n3.8\nAditya Birla Activ Fit\n3.8\n3.5\n4.6\n3.8\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\n4\n3\n4\n3.8\nHeads Up:\nIt takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyse a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision. This is why we propose a better alternative - taking a 30-minute FREE consultation with Dittoâs certified advisors.\nWe have a spam-free guarantee, and weâll never push you to buy a plan. Donât delay this - we have limited slots every day, so\nbook a quick call here\nbefore they run out.\nLimited slots! Book today!\nOur Methodology\nIf youâre new to insurance, we highly recommend you check out our\nHealth Insurance guide for beginners\n.\nNow, we compiled this list using two broad criteria.\nThe first one is our assessment of the insurance company marketing a given policy. Any company can float a health insurance plan whose\nfeatures\nlook amazing on paper. But if customers have trouble buying the policy, making a claim, or resolving issues, then ultimately the product features donât count for much. So weâve taken into consideration several operational and financial metrics, like claim settlement numbers, track record, and solvency ratios to rank every health insurance company in India.\nWe then took each product and\ncompared\ntheir features. Now bear in mind that most insurance companies will have a basic affordable product, a comprehensive product, and a premium product. The basic product doesnât offer a lot of protection. And the premium products are too expensive and have features that often donât add a lot of value for most people. So while compiling this list weâve only considered comprehensive products that offer significant protection while not burning a hole in your pocket.\nWith that introduction out of the way, letâs look at the top health insurance plans in a little more detail.\nBest Health Insurance Plans\n1\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure Health Insurance\nHDFC Ergo\nOptima Secure takes the top rank this year. It was introduced to replace the companyâs best-selling product -\nOptima Restore\n. In just 2 years since its launch, it has done just that â exceeding expectations from all corners and emerging as our top recommendation for the best health insurance plan for the year 2024.\nInsurer Rating\n4.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n3.5\nFinal Rating\n4.2\nWhy\nOptima Secure\nis our top recommendation\nOptima Secure is an extremely comprehensive policy. It has no room rent restrictions, no\nco-pay clause\n, covers\nAyush treatments\nand has reasonable\nwaiting periods\nfor\npre-existing diseases\n. It also has a bunch of industry-first features that will excite a lot of people.\nSecure Benefit:\nSecure benefit instantly doubles your cover the moment you buy the policy. So for instance, if you buy a a policy with a sum insured of â¹10 lakhs, you get the â¹10 lakhs as base cover and an additional â¹10 lakhs as âSecureâ benefit. Effectively you get double the cover without having to pay more.\nProtect Benefit:\nUsually, insurers donât cover non-medical expenses that could include things like bandages, syringes, gloves, and masks. Even if they do cover it, they ask you to pay extra. But Optima Secure covers these expenses at no additional cost.\nPlus Benefit:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, Optima Secure has completely remodeled the bonus feature and is now offering 50% bonus cover every year irrespective of whether you made a claim. The bonus could go as high as 100% if you renew your policy for 2 consecutive years.\nOn a stand-alone basis, these features may not mean much. But when you compare it against Optima Restore, youâll see why this is a huge leap.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

So if affordability is a concern, itâs best to look at other plans on this list.\n2\nCare Supreme Health Insurance\nCare\nSupreme is second on our list as it is now the best-selling health insurance policy within Careâs stable. The company launched this plan to compete against the likes of HDFC Ergoâs Optima Secure and Niva Bupaâs Reassure. And considering the features on board and the price point at which it sells, Care Supreme can be a very attractive option for a lot of people.\nInsurer Rating\n3.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n4\nWhy\nCare Supreme\nis No.2 on our list\nItâs a comprehensive plan, that offers pretty much every\nhealth insurance add-ons\nyou need, and it is perhaps one of the most affordable plans in this category. Some of the top features include:\nUnlimited Automatic Restoration\n:\nCare Supreme will automatically refill your cover every time you make a claim. So if you have a policy with a cover of â¹10 lakhs and you make a claim totalling â¹2 lakhs, it will restore your cover back to â¹10 lakhs the moment you make the claim.\nNo Bonus clawbacks:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, they will usually clawback a part of the bonus if you ever make a claim. Care Supreme however has no such clause and you will have your bonus intact even if you make multiple claims.\nAffordability:\nThis isnât a feature as much. But itâs still worth noting that the difference in price point between Care Supreme and other similar plans is substantial. For instance, Optima Secure (our top recommendation) is nearly 30% more expensive when compared to Care Supreme for the profiles listed below.\nPremium comparison\nOptima Secure\nCare Supreme\nMale 28, living in Bangalore\nâ¹12,892\nâ¹7,701\nFamily of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹24,418\nâ¹14,357\nCouple of an advanced age -\nMale 66, Female 63\nNA\nâ¹62,210\nRead our full comparison report of\nCare Supreme vs HDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThere is a 4-year waiting period for pre-existing diseases and the only way to cut this down is to buy separate add-ons. Thereâs also another insurer-specific reason why we arenât ranking this plan higher. The claim settlement and complaint numbers for Care arenât that amazing.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE!

Also, Reassure 2.0 builds on the success of Reassure by offering 3 variants of the same plan with extremely comprehensive features at very competitive price points. For the purpose of this list, we are considering the Platinum variant of Reassure 2.0 which sits right between the\nBronze\nvariant and the\nTitanium\nvariant.\nInsurer Rating\n3.2\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.8\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Reassure 2.0 is third on our list\nIt is one of the best policies in its class. It's economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits at a very attractive price point. Hereâs a select few features that we like:\nForever\nRestoration\n:\nYour cover is restored in full the moment you make a claim. And you will have the extra cover throughout your policy term. Also, the restored sum will be added on top of your existing cover and you can claim the full amount (what's left of your base cover and the restored sum) while making a claim.\nAge lock benefit:\nYour premiums will not increase until you make a claim. However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nCarry Forward Bonus:\nEvery year the policy will calculate the unutilized base cover and transfer it to the next year. So if you started with â¹10 lakhs and you made a claim totaling â¹2 lakhs, the remaining â¹8 lakhs will be added to your cover next year and you will have â¹18 lakhs (â¹10 lakhs base cover + â¹8 Lakhs unutilized base cover + bonus) for the next year.\nReassure\nReassure 2.0\nForever Restoration\nAge Lock Benefit\nCarry Forward Bonus\nPremiums for Family of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹21,306\nâ¹19,560\nRead our full comparison report of\nNiva Bupa ReAssure vs Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThereâs nothing to complain about the features. But there are a few issues with the insurer. After the change in management (Max Bupa to Niva Bupa), we have seen a general rise in the amount of complaints. Our own experience working with the insurer on the claim settlement process has left us a bit frustrated. So we canât possibly place them any higher despite the attractive price point and the industry-first features on hand.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

Limited slots available.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\n4\nAditya Birla Activ Fit Health Insurance\nAditya Birla\nmakes our list at number 4 because most people we tend to fall between the ages of 18 and 45. And this policy is designed specifically for them. It offers significant discounts if youâre healthy, it has no outrageous restrictions, a very good restoration benefit, supercharged bonus feature and it sells at a very attractive price point.\nInsurer Rating\n3.8\nProduct Feature Rating\n3.5\nAffordability\n4.6\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Aditya Birla Activ Fit takes the 4th spot\nAs we noted already itâs a comprehensive policy and it offers some very nice benefits for people who keep healthy:\nUpfront good health discount:\nYou get an upfront 10% discount on your first policy premium by simply undergoing a successful health assessment.\n100% Binge Refill:\nYour cover will be restored in full every time you make a claim. It offers unlimited restoration.\nMaternity and OPD Coverage:\nYou also get some coverage for\nmaternity-related expenses\nand\noutpatient consultations\n. And while we donât usually recommend these features (since it can burn a hole in your pocket), Aditya Bira offers all of this and more without asking you to pay a bomb.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nWhile the product features are decent and the insurer does okay on most fronts, the maximum entry age for the product is capped at 45 years. So if youâre older than 45 you canât buy this policy, which could be frustrating for those who are above the ages of 45.\n5\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\nBajaj Allianz\nHealth Guard Gold makes our list at no 5. The plan does what you would expect from a comprehensive health policy. Itâs not very expensive. And Bajaj Allianz has been posting very respectable claim settlement numbers so far. All things considered, this is a solid plan from a solid company.\nInsurer Rating\n4\nProduct Feature Rating\n3\nAffordability\n4\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\ntakes the 5th spot\nAs we noted earlier, itâs important to look at product features. But itâs even more important to evaluate the insurer. And when we compare Bajaj Allianzâs claim settlement numbers over the last 3 years against other insurers on this list, you will see why this is one of our top 5 recommendations.\nClaim Settlement Ratios\nBajaj Allianz\nAditya Birla\nCare\nHDFC Ergo\nNiva Bupa\n2020-2021\n94.5%\n89.3%\n95.2%\n97%\n90.7%\n2021-2022\n90.8%\n93.7%\n87%\n100%\n90.8%\n2022-2023\n96.8%\n95.9%\n90%\n95.5%\n90.5%\n2023-2024\n95%\n95%\n90%\n98%\n91%\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nAll the other products that make our list offer significant protection by way of extending features like unlimited restoration, supercharged bonus features and unique benefits that you may not find anywhere else. The problem with Health Guard Gold is that it does what you expect it do, but there arenât any shiny features to boast of. So that should explain why we didnât place the plan higher on the list.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, weâve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

First, you compare the insurer â their operational performance, claim settlement figures, business scale and Net Promoter Score. Next, you compare the policy itself. You look at the policy features, the price point at which theyâre selling, and the specific use cases they try to address. You take into account every metric and then make a qualified choice on what product you want to buy.\nHowever, if you do not intend to do this yourself, weâve churned out comparisons for most health insurance policies out there. Just plug in what policies you want to compare and we will have a full-blown comparison chart and an extended explanation alongside it. Including a recommendation on what policy best suits you.\nFriendly reminder:\nItâs easy to get lost comparing policies and premiums.

Just 30 minutes to clarify all your doubts.\nBook a call now!\nIntroduction\nMost people are used to a simplistic comparison model. Take for instance a rating method involving stars. Every product is rated along a 5-star scale and you can tell whatâs better by seeing who gets a higher star rating. However, this system doesnât work well when you are comparing two health insurance policies. You could be comparing a policy specifically meant for a heart patient with a policy marketed for the general public. The star rating will have you convinced that the heart policy is a poor alternative since these products usually come with many restrictions. The reality however is that the âgeneral policyâ may not be made available to you since your present a specific heart condition. In which case your only alternative is the heart policy. And a star rating may mislead you into buying the âgeneral policyâ and youâll likely waste a lot of time in the process.\nSo instead of simply assigning a star rating based on your subjective assessment. Itâs better to evaluate every policy along two verticals.\n1\nCompany Specific Comparison\nThis is where you evaluate the insurer. You look at the companyâs track record, its claim settlement numbers, operational efficiencies, network hospitals and general customer satisfaction. If at any point you find that an insurer is deficient in this department, youâd be better off buying a sub-par policy from a different insurer as opposed to buying a top-tier policy from this insurance company.\n2\nPolicy Specific Features\nYou look at different policy features i.e. compare restrictions on room rent, sub-limits, co-payment clause, no-claim bonus extended, restoration policy and other benefits including maternity, dental and international treatments and wrap it up with a use-case comparison. Once you go through each line item, you can then make an assessment if a policy is best suited for you.\nSo letâs look at how you compare two different insurance companies first.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nIf you want help with selecting the best health policy tailored to your needs, book a FREE call with our experts today by clicking here.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nComparing Insurers - How to decide which insurance company is better?\n1\nTrack Record\nA good insurance company should have an extensive track record. For instance, you could always take a gamble by buying an insurance policy from a company that has only been in existence for the past year. However, you will know precious little about the companyâs operational metrics during this time. Even if you did have some tentative figures, itâs entirely possible that the numbers may go for a toss next year when they expand. So you canât really make a comprehensive assessment with this little information. However, if you have a company with an extensive track record. Then you can consider their performance, see if itâs been consistent over the years and adjudge their performance better.\nBut what is a good track record?\nThe insurance sector in India was only privatised in 2000. Meaning most private companies have a track record of less than 22 years. However, any company with a track record of 10 years or greater would be a good bet. A company with a track record of 5 years and above is decent. And we generally urge people to avoid any company with a track record of less than 5 years.\n2\nNetwork Hospitals\nInsurance companies usually partner with a select network of hospitals with the promise of settling all claims on a cashless basis. In other words, if youâre in a network hospital, the insurer may settle the bills without you putting up a single penny. And itâs a godsend for people strapped for, well, âcashâ.\nOn the flip side, if youâre not in a network hospital, youâll have to pay the bills yourself and prepare for a rather arduous journey. Youâll have to collate all the medical records, fill out the claim form, get the hospital to sign on it. Put all the documents in order. Send them over to the insurer, wait for them to evaluate everything. Answer any additional queries they may have. Furnish other records that they may seek. Wait some more. And finally, after all this time, maybe the insurer will reimburse your bills.\nNeedless to say, a better network hospital bodes well for you. But what exactly is better. Well, in our experience, any insurer with a hospital network spanning 8000+ hospitals is a decent bet. Anything between 5,000 and 8,000 is okay. And less than 5,000 is a no-no.\n3\nClaim Settlement Ratio\nClaim settlement ratio tells you about the percentage of claims settled by an insurer during a specified period. Put another way, a claim settlement ratio of 90 tells you that the insurance company settled 90 claims for every 100 claims they book during the year.\nThe figure is calculated using the formula: Claims settled / (Claims booked + Claims outstanding at the beginning - Claims outstanding at the end)\nCompany\nCLAIM SETTLEMENT RATIO\n(avg. of last 3 years)\nNew India Assurance\n99\n%\nHDFC Ergo\n98\n%\nSBI\n97\n%\nDigit\n97\n%\nOriental Insurance\n96\n%\nTATA AIG\n96\n%\nAcko\n96\n%\nIffco Tokio\n95\n%\nAditya Birla\n95\n%\nUniversal Sompo\n95\n%\nBajaj Allianz\n95\n%\nUnited India\n94\n%\nRoyal Sundaram\n94\n%\nNational Insurance\n93\n%\nZuno (erstwhile Edelweiss)\n92\n%\nNiva Bupa (erstwhile Max Bupa)\n91\n%\nManipal Cigna\n90\n%\nCare\n90\n%\nReliance\n89\n%\nICICI Lombard\n85\n%\nBharti Axa\n85\n%\nStar Health\n83\n%\nNavi\n64\n%\nIn our opinion, a claim settlement ratio of 90% and above is stellar. A claim settlement ratio of 80-90% is decent. And anything less than 80% is a no-go.\nYou can find the claim settlement ratios in our comparison tables. Or you could go check out IRDAIâs annual report for the unadulterated figures.\n4\nOperational Efficiencies\nThe last thing you probably have to check for is operational efficiency. How well do insurers deal with application errors? How do they deal with the paperwork? Are they receptive to customer complaints? Are they responsive when you raise a ticket?\nItâs not immediately obvious if a particular insurer is robust in this department. However, there are a few ground rules you could follow. You would be well advised to steer clear of public insurers. In our experience, government-owned insurance companies have a pretty poor track record when it comes to being receptive to customer complaints. Itâs not to say that private insurers are far better, but they do perform relatively well when compared to their state-owned counterparts.\nBut even amongst private insurers, you have some who are more in tune with their customers and others who donât care as much. Once again, itâs not easy to tell them apart. But you could scour the web for some data points. Youâll find information on customer complaints, performance surveys, social media acceptance online. And you may have to put them all together to form an opinion. On the flipside, you could also talk to insurance experts, like our advisors at Ditto and take our help in this matter.\nPut together, these 4 metrics should help you shortlist an insurance company. But once you get here, you have to then shortlist a policy based on features. So letâs how we do that.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nIf you want help with selecting the best health policy tailored to your needs, book a FREE call with our experts today by clicking here.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nComparing policy features: How to tell which policy has better features\nPrice\nThe first metric is always the same â Price. You want to be able to buy a policy thatâs relatively affordable with decent features. Whatâs a good price point for a policy you ask? Well, thereâs no easy answer. It depends on your age, your health conditions, your location and the features you pick. Ideally, you want to buy a policy that offers value for money i.e you want something that isnât overly expensive but isnât very basic in structure. You can use our comparison tool to tell which policies offer.\nCo-payment\nWith a co-payment clause, the insurer will mandate that you pay a part of the bill. So if the bill adds up to Rs. 2,00,000 and the co-payment is set at 20% then you could be asked to pay Rs. 40,000 from the bill. Ideally, you want to buy a policy that doesnât impose a co-payment clause.\nRoom Rent Restrictions\nIf the policy does impose room rent restrictions then the insurer may only let you stay in a room of a certain specification or impose a cap on the total room rent. If you were to breach either criterion then the insurance company may ask you to pay a portion of all the expenses you incurred while staying in the room. Once again, the best approach is to pick a policy that doesnât impose any restrictions on this front. However, if you have to settle for something less, you probably could go with a policy that extends a single private room with AC.\nAyush Benefit\nMost policies only cover treatments administered in a registered medical facility. However, on some occasions, you may want to pursue alternative treatments including homoeopathy, Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. These treatments are collectively categorized as Ayush treatments. If you had to pick between two products, youâd probably be best advised to pick a policy that extends Ayush Benefits as well.\nWaiting Periods\nIf youâre suffering from a lifestyle condition or if youâve had surgery in the past, or if youâre dealing with an acute or chronic illness at the time of buying the policy, then the insurer may classify this as a pre-existing disease. And they may tell you that they will only cover these illnesses after some time. This cooling period is referred to as the Pre-existing-disease waiting period.\nNo-claim Bonus\nSome policies will tell you that they will incentivize you for not making a claim in any given year. And they offer such incentives by offering extra cover on top of the existing sum insured. This extra cover is categorized as a no-claim bonus. Ideally, a 50% no-claim bonus every year is the gold standard. A 20% no-claim bonus is doable. But anything less than that is just insignificant.\nMaternity Benefit\nIf youâre hospitalized during childbirth, then you may have to incur significant costs during delivery of your newborn, child care and other related matters during the course of the hospitalization. These costs are collectively termed maternity costs. And while itâs always better to prioritize a policy that extends maternity benefits, know that this usually pushes the price of the product much higher. So you may have to take that into consideration too.\nOutpatient consultation\nDoctor visits and regular consultations are categorized as Outpatient consultations (or OPD treatments). And just like maternity benefits, itâs a nice-to-have feature, but know that it comes at a significant cost.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, weâve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

Similarly, a heart care policy will likely extend policies to âheart-patientsâ when others may reject their application altogether. If you fall in this bucket, maybe you should prioritize this feature above all else.\nFrequently Compared Policies\nHDFC Ergo Optima Restore vs Niva Bupa ReAssure\nHDFC Ergo Optima Restore vs HDFC Ergo myHealth Suraksha Gold\nCare Plus Youth vs Star Health Comprehensive\nStar Health Comprehensive vs HDFC Ergo Energy Silver\nConclusion\nUltimately, comparing policies isnât as easy as just looking at the features.

The more claims are settled, the more reliable the insurer is.\nOne should be aware that the claim settlement ratio does not indicate whether a claim has been entirely or partially resolved before using it.

So picking out the best health insurance plans can be challenging.\nThis is why we put together this list to help you shortlist the best\nhealth insurance policies\nin India for 2025.\nBest Health Insurance Plans in India 2025\nTop Health Plans\nInsurer Rating\nFeature Rating\nAffordability\nFinal Rating\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n4.5\n4.5\n3.5\n4.2\nCare Supreme\n3.5\n4.5\n4.8\n4\nNiva Bupa Reassure 2.0\n3.2\n4.8\n4.8\n3.8\nAditya Birla Activ Fit\n3.8\n3.5\n4.6\n3.8\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\n4\n3\n4\n3.8\nHeads Up:\nIt takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyse a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.

Book today!\nOur Methodology\nIf youâre new to insurance, we highly recommend you check out our\nHealth Insurance guide for beginners\n.\nNow, we compiled this list using two broad criteria.\nThe first one is our assessment of the insurance company marketing a given policy. Any company can float a health insurance plan whose\nfeatures\nlook amazing on paper. But if customers have trouble buying the policy, making a claim, or resolving issues, then ultimately the product features donât count for much. So weâve taken into consideration several operational and financial metrics, like claim settlement numbers, track record, and solvency ratios to rank every health insurance company in India.\nWe then took each product and\ncompared\ntheir features. Now bear in mind that most insurance companies will have a basic affordable product, a comprehensive product, and a premium product. The basic product doesnât offer a lot of protection. And the premium products are too expensive and have features that often donât add a lot of value for most people. So while compiling this list weâve only considered comprehensive products that offer significant protection while not burning a hole in your pocket.\nWith that introduction out of the way, letâs look at the top health insurance plans in a little more detail.\nBest Health Insurance Plans\n1\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure Health Insurance\nHDFC Ergo\nOptima Secure takes the top rank this year. It was introduced to replace the companyâs best-selling product -\nOptima Restore\n. In just 2 years since its launch, it has done just that â exceeding expectations from all corners and emerging as our top recommendation for the best health insurance plan for the year 2024.\nInsurer Rating\n4.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n3.5\nFinal Rating\n4.2\nWhy\nOptima Secure\nis our top recommendation\nOptima Secure is an extremely comprehensive policy. It has no room rent restrictions, no\nco-pay clause\n, covers\nAyush treatments\nand has reasonable\nwaiting periods\nfor\npre-existing diseases\n. It also has a bunch of industry-first features that will excite a lot of people.\nSecure Benefit:\nSecure benefit instantly doubles your cover the moment you buy the policy. So for instance, if you buy a a policy with a sum insured of â¹10 lakhs, you get the â¹10 lakhs as base cover and an additional â¹10 lakhs as âSecureâ benefit. Effectively you get double the cover without having to pay more.\nProtect Benefit:\nUsually, insurers donât cover non-medical expenses that could include things like bandages, syringes, gloves, and masks. Even if they do cover it, they ask you to pay extra. But Optima Secure covers these expenses at no additional cost.\nPlus Benefit:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, Optima Secure has completely remodeled the bonus feature and is now offering 50% bonus cover every year irrespective of whether you made a claim. The bonus could go as high as 100% if you renew your policy for 2 consecutive years.\nOn a stand-alone basis, these features may not mean much. But when you compare it against Optima Restore, youâll see why this is a huge leap.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

So if affordability is a concern, itâs best to look at other plans on this list.\n2\nCare Supreme Health Insurance\nCare\nSupreme is second on our list as it is now the best-selling health insurance policy within Careâs stable. The company launched this plan to compete against the likes of HDFC Ergoâs Optima Secure and Niva Bupaâs Reassure. And considering the features on board and the price point at which it sells, Care Supreme can be a very attractive option for a lot of people.\nInsurer Rating\n3.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n4\nWhy\nCare Supreme\nis No.2 on our list\nItâs a comprehensive plan, that offers pretty much every\nhealth insurance add-ons\nyou need, and it is perhaps one of the most affordable plans in this category. Some of the top features include:\nUnlimited Automatic Restoration\n:\nCare Supreme will automatically refill your cover every time you make a claim. So if you have a policy with a cover of â¹10 lakhs and you make a claim totalling â¹2 lakhs, it will restore your cover back to â¹10 lakhs the moment you make the claim.\nNo Bonus clawbacks:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, they will usually clawback a part of the bonus if you ever make a claim. Care Supreme however has no such clause and you will have your bonus intact even if you make multiple claims.\nAffordability:\nThis isnât a feature as much. But itâs still worth noting that the difference in price point between Care Supreme and other similar plans is substantial. For instance, Optima Secure (our top recommendation) is nearly 30% more expensive when compared to Care Supreme for the profiles listed below.\nPremium comparison\nOptima Secure\nCare Supreme\nMale 28, living in Bangalore\nâ¹12,892\nâ¹7,701\nFamily of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹24,418\nâ¹14,357\nCouple of an advanced age -\nMale 66, Female 63\nNA\nâ¹62,210\nRead our full comparison report of\nCare Supreme vs HDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThere is a 4-year waiting period for pre-existing diseases and the only way to cut this down is to buy separate add-ons. Thereâs also another insurer-specific reason why we arenât ranking this plan higher. The claim settlement and complaint numbers for Care arenât that amazing.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE!

Also, Reassure 2.0 builds on the success of Reassure by offering 3 variants of the same plan with extremely comprehensive features at very competitive price points. For the purpose of this list, we are considering the Platinum variant of Reassure 2.0 which sits right between the\nBronze\nvariant and the\nTitanium\nvariant.\nInsurer Rating\n3.2\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.8\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Reassure 2.0 is third on our list\nIt is one of the best policies in its class. It's economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits at a very attractive price point. Hereâs a select few features that we like:\nForever\nRestoration\n:\nYour cover is restored in full the moment you make a claim. And you will have the extra cover throughout your policy term. Also, the restored sum will be added on top of your existing cover and you can claim the full amount (what's left of your base cover and the restored sum) while making a claim.\nAge lock benefit:\nYour premiums will not increase until you make a claim. However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nCarry Forward Bonus:\nEvery year the policy will calculate the unutilized base cover and transfer it to the next year. So if you started with â¹10 lakhs and you made a claim totaling â¹2 lakhs, the remaining â¹8 lakhs will be added to your cover next year and you will have â¹18 lakhs (â¹10 lakhs base cover + â¹8 Lakhs unutilized base cover + bonus) for the next year.\nReassure\nReassure 2.0\nForever Restoration\nAge Lock Benefit\nCarry Forward Bonus\nPremiums for Family of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹21,306\nâ¹19,560\nRead our full comparison report of\nNiva Bupa ReAssure vs Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThereâs nothing to complain about the features. But there are a few issues with the insurer. After the change in management (Max Bupa to Niva Bupa), we have seen a general rise in the amount of complaints. Our own experience working with the insurer on the claim settlement process has left us a bit frustrated. So we canât possibly place them any higher despite the attractive price point and the industry-first features on hand.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

Limited slots available.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\n4\nAditya Birla Activ Fit Health Insurance\nAditya Birla\nmakes our list at number 4 because most people we tend to fall between the ages of 18 and 45. And this policy is designed specifically for them. It offers significant discounts if youâre healthy, it has no outrageous restrictions, a very good restoration benefit, supercharged bonus feature and it sells at a very attractive price point.\nInsurer Rating\n3.8\nProduct Feature Rating\n3.5\nAffordability\n4.6\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Aditya Birla Activ Fit takes the 4th spot\nAs we noted already itâs a comprehensive policy and it offers some very nice benefits for people who keep healthy:\nUpfront good health discount:\nYou get an upfront 10% discount on your first policy premium by simply undergoing a successful health assessment.\n100% Binge Refill:\nYour cover will be restored in full every time you make a claim. It offers unlimited restoration.\nMaternity and OPD Coverage:\nYou also get some coverage for\nmaternity-related expenses\nand\noutpatient consultations\n. And while we donât usually recommend these features (since it can burn a hole in your pocket), Aditya Bira offers all of this and more without asking you to pay a bomb.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nWhile the product features are decent and the insurer does okay on most fronts, the maximum entry age for the product is capped at 45 years. So if youâre older than 45 you canât buy this policy, which could be frustrating for those who are above the ages of 45.\n5\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\nBajaj Allianz\nHealth Guard Gold makes our list at no 5. The plan does what you would expect from a comprehensive health policy. Itâs not very expensive. And Bajaj Allianz has been posting very respectable claim settlement numbers so far. All things considered, this is a solid plan from a solid company.\nInsurer Rating\n4\nProduct Feature Rating\n3\nAffordability\n4\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\ntakes the 5th spot\nAs we noted earlier, itâs important to look at product features. But itâs even more important to evaluate the insurer. And when we compare Bajaj Allianzâs claim settlement numbers over the last 3 years against other insurers on this list, you will see why this is one of our top 5 recommendations.\nClaim Settlement Ratios\nBajaj Allianz\nAditya Birla\nCare\nHDFC Ergo\nNiva Bupa\n2020-2021\n94.5%\n89.3%\n95.2%\n97%\n90.7%\n2021-2022\n90.8%\n93.7%\n87%\n100%\n90.8%\n2022-2023\n96.8%\n95.9%\n90%\n95.5%\n90.5%\n2023-2024\n95%\n95%\n90%\n98%\n91%\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nAll the other products that make our list offer significant protection by way of extending features like unlimited restoration, supercharged bonus features and unique benefits that you may not find anywhere else. The problem with Health Guard Gold is that it does what you expect it do, but there arenât any shiny features to boast of. So that should explain why we didnât place the plan higher on the list.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, weâve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

    "text": "22 December 2023\n•\nHealth Insurance\nAcko Platinum Health Insurance: Customised Review\nTable of Contents\nWhen you plan to purchase a health insurance plan, you generally look for policies featuring a minimum waiting period, no copayments, no room rent restrictions, no disease-wise sub-limits, and adequate coverage at affordable premiums. However, such ideal clubbing of features under one plan is difficult to find.\nBut it seems like ACKO’s Platinum Health Insurance Policy has managed to achieve all of that (at least as per its marketing highlights and on pen and paper). The policy claims to have\nno waiting period\n, is the No. 1\nhealth insurance plan\nin the industry (as declared by LiveMint), has no copayments, no room rent restrictions, and more.\nHowever, since Acko is a fairly new player in the market, and the plan is only a few months old and already gaining huge popularity, we have a couple of questions - Will Acko continue to be credible? Is Acko’s Platinum Health Insurance Plan worth the hype?\nLet’s find out!\nQuick Verdict on ACKO PLATINUM\nA solid pick in terms of the plan since it is pocket-friendly, has no waiting period for specified ailments, covers consumables, and offers unlimited restoration benefits. However, ACKO is a fairly new player in the market and we are yet to see how they deal with claims in the future. Will it continue to be this affordable while also dealing with claims effectively? We will have to wait and see!\nACKO Platinum Plan: Brief Overview\nFounded in 2016 and backed by Amazon, Acko is a tech-first insurance company that recently entered the health industry. With a Claim Settlement Ratio of 95.80% over the last 3 years, surpassing the industry average of 90.97%, and a complaint volume of 10.31 per 10,000 claims processed (industry average = 24.029), Acko demonstrates solid performance. The insurer boasts a network of 7100 hospitals.\nHeads Up: It takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyze a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.\nThis is why we propose a better alternative - taking a 30-minute FREE consultation with Ditto’s certified advisors. We have a spam-free guarantee, and we’ll never push you to buy a plan. Don’t delay this - we have limited slots every day, so\nbook a quick call here\nbefore they run out.\nHowever, Acko is one of the newest insurers in the market with a short history of selling retail health policies. And considering they don’t have an extensive track record, we are sceptical about including them in the list of\ntop health insurance providers\n.\nOn the other hand, the Acko Platinum plan (which comes in 2 variants - 1 crore coverage and unlimited coverage) seems like a standup policy with a host of decent features at pocket-friendly premiums. However, the plan has some restrictions on its provided features.\nLet’s take a quick look at some of these features -\nFeatures of ACKO Platinum Health Insurance Plan\nFEATURES\nDETAILS\nCoverage\nUp to ₹1 crore / Unlimited\nCopayment\nNone\nRoom rent restrictions\nNone\nCoverage for consumables\nYes\nAffordability of premiums\nYes\nWaiting period\n0 (initial waiting period) / 0 - 4 years (pre-existing conditions) / 0 (specific illness)\nDaycare coverage\nYes\nDomiciliary coverage\nYes\nAYUSH coverage\nYes\nDisease-wise sub-limits\nNo\nRestoration benefit\nUnlimited\nFree annual health check-ups\nYes\nDeductible\nNo\nShould You Buy ACKO PLATINUM?\nIn our experience, when buying a health insurance plan, you should prioritise both policy features and the insurer's financial stability and intent, as they significantly impact claim clearance and settlement.\nSo, let’s take a look at both the ACKO PLatinum health insurance plan and Acko to determine if you should be purchasing the policy at all.\nZERO Waiting period -\nNO! Unlike the marketed front, Acko Platinum doesn’t have a zero waiting period. As you know there are three types of waiting periods in health insurance policies -\n- Initial waiting period - 30 days\n- Pre-existing waiting period - Ranges from 2 to 4 years\n- Specific illness waiting period - Usually of 2 years.\nWith the ACKO Platinum health insurance plan, two waiting periods are waived - initial and specific illness. This means that if you have cataracts, kidney stones, and any such specific illnesses, you don’t have to wait for coverage. However, in case you have any\npre-existing conditions\n, you\nwill still be waiting for a period ranging from 1 to 4 years\n.\nMoreover, in case you have pre-existing conditions, ACKO will be suggesting that you avail of the Standard plan instead of the Platinum variant. This is a smart move on Acko’s part since it will mitigate the claims raised in their Platinum variant and thus avoid situations in which they have to either increase premiums or deny claims.\n2.\nRoom rent and type -\nAcko’s Platinum plan imposes no room rent/type restrictions. So, whether you opt for a Deluxe room or an AC single room - you are covered both ways.\nCTA\n3.\nNo disease-wise sub-limits -\nIrrespective of which disease you are diagnosed with and get treated for, if it's covered under ACKO Platinum, you get complete coverage. There is no capping on the maximum amount that is assigned to the treatment of an ailment.\n4.\nNo deductibles -\nSome health insurers (especially if they extend an affordable premium) impose a deductible, a threshold amount that you need to pay towards a hospital invoice before the insurance cover kicks in for the residual amount. However, with Acko’s Platinum health insurance policy, there is no such deductible.\n5.\nConsumable coverage -\nWith the ACKO Platinum plan, a majority of your consumables (aids and equipment used in medical surgeries/treatments) are covered as an in-built feature.\n6.\nAffordability of premiums -\nAcko Platinum Health Insurance plan is one of the most affordable policies out there in the market, hands down. Here’s a quick look at its premiums -\nLet’s assume that the policyholder is a 25-year-old, with no pre-existing conditions, seeking a plan of ₹1 crore. The premiums for the best plans in the market can be compared as follows -\nACKO PLATINUM\nHDFC ERGO OPTIMA SECURE\nCARE SUPREME\nNIVABUPA REASSURE 2.0 (TITANIUM)\n₹9,214\n₹22,420\n₹16,596\n₹23,078\n7.\nThe credibility and future financial prospects of Acko -\nWith ACKO, we have two concerns -\nThe company is fairly new player without an extensive track record in the retail health insurance market\nCurrently, since Acko is new to the market, we haven’t seen many complaints on the claim front. However, what happens when it sells hundreds and thousands of policies and the claims start coming in thick and fast? You could be looking at\nspiked premiums (compared to the affordable numbers now), or\npartial claim settlements\nWhile we hope this is not the future for ACKO, this is something that prospective customers have to evaluate before they consider Acko’s platinum plan. However if you set aside these worries, then Acko’s Platinum plan almost certainly looks like its one of the best plans in the market.\nWhat’s Unique with ACKO PLATINUM?\nAcko Platinum offers one of the most affordable premiums for ₹1 crore coverage and has waived off the waiting period on specific illnesses and the initial 30-day span. The policy’s in-built coverage for consumables is also a highlight considering not many policies extend the same.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, we’ve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy. Why customers like Arun below love us:\n✅No-Spam & No Salesmen\n✅\nRated 4.9/5 on Google Reviews by 5,000+ happy customers\n✅\nBacked by Zerodha\n✅\n100% Free Consultation\nYou can book a FREE consultation here. Slots are running out, so make sure you\nbook a call now.\nConclusion\nAcko’s venture into the health insurance sector has started with a bang considering the ACKO Platinum health insurance plan’s recent popularity. However, the insurer’s short track record with retail health plans is something that prospective customers will have to consider before they consider buying Acko’s Platinum plan.\nLast updated on\n24 February 2025"

So picking out the best health insurance plans can be challenging.\nThis is why we put together this list to help you shortlist the best\nhealth insurance policies\nin India for 2025.\nBest Health Insurance Plans in India 2025\nTop Health Plans\nInsurer Rating\nFeature Rating\nAffordability\nFinal Rating\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n4.5\n4.5\n3.5\n4.2\nCare Supreme\n3.5\n4.5\n4.8\n4\nNiva Bupa Reassure 2.0\n3.2\n4.8\n4.8\n3.8\nAditya Birla Activ Fit\n3.8\n3.5\n4.6\n3.8\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\n4\n3\n4\n3.8\nHeads Up:\nIt takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyse a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.

Donât delay this - we have limited slots every day, so\nbook a quick call here\nbefore they run out.\nLimited slots! Book today!\nOur Methodology\nIf youâre new to insurance, we highly recommend you check out our\nHealth Insurance guide for beginners\n.\nNow, we compiled this list using two broad criteria.\nThe first one is our assessment of the insurance company marketing a given policy. Any company can float a health insurance plan whose\nfeatures\nlook amazing on paper. But if customers have trouble buying the policy, making a claim, or resolving issues, then ultimately the product features donât count for much. So weâve taken into consideration several operational and financial metrics, like claim settlement numbers, track record, and solvency ratios to rank every health insurance company in India.\nWe then took each product and\ncompared\ntheir features. Now bear in mind that most insurance companies will have a basic affordable product, a comprehensive product, and a premium product. The basic product doesnât offer a lot of protection. And the premium products are too expensive and have features that often donât add a lot of value for most people. So while compiling this list weâve only considered comprehensive products that offer significant protection while not burning a hole in your pocket.\nWith that introduction out of the way, letâs look at the top health insurance plans in a little more detail.\nBest Health Insurance Plans\n1\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure Health Insurance\nHDFC Ergo\nOptima Secure takes the top rank this year. It was introduced to replace the companyâs best-selling product -\nOptima Restore\n. In just 2 years since its launch, it has done just that â exceeding expectations from all corners and emerging as our top recommendation for the best health insurance plan for the year 2024.\nInsurer Rating\n4.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n3.5\nFinal Rating\n4.2\nWhy\nOptima Secure\nis our top recommendation\nOptima Secure is an extremely comprehensive policy. It has no room rent restrictions, no\nco-pay clause\n, covers\nAyush treatments\nand has reasonable\nwaiting periods\nfor\npre-existing diseases\n. It also has a bunch of industry-first features that will excite a lot of people.\nSecure Benefit:\nSecure benefit instantly doubles your cover the moment you buy the policy. So for instance, if you buy a a policy with a sum insured of â¹10 lakhs, you get the â¹10 lakhs as base cover and an additional â¹10 lakhs as âSecureâ benefit. Effectively you get double the cover without having to pay more.\nProtect Benefit:\nUsually, insurers donât cover non-medical expenses that could include things like bandages, syringes, gloves, and masks. Even if they do cover it, they ask you to pay extra. But Optima Secure covers these expenses at no additional cost.\nPlus Benefit:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, Optima Secure has completely remodeled the bonus feature and is now offering 50% bonus cover every year irrespective of whether you made a claim. The bonus could go as high as 100% if you renew your policy for 2 consecutive years.\nOn a stand-alone basis, these features may not mean much. But when you compare it against Optima Restore, youâll see why this is a huge leap.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE! Book a call now. Limited slots available.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nOptima Restore\nOptima Secure\nSecure Benefit:\nInstant doubling of cover\nProtect Benefit:\nCover for non-medical expenses\nPlus Benefit:\nBonus cover of 50% every year irrespective of whether you make a claim\nAutomatic Restore:\nYour base cover restores in full every time you make a claim\nOptima Secure also comes from HDFC Ergoâs stable, an insurer whose\nclaim settlement\nnumbers and track record are pretty robust.\nRead our full comparison report of\nHDFC Ergo Optima Restore vs HDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nWhile the premiums may be reasonable for some profiles, Optima Secure is generally more expensive when compared to similar plans on the market. So if affordability is a concern, itâs best to look at other plans on this list.\n2\nCare Supreme Health Insurance\nCare\nSupreme is second on our list as it is now the best-selling health insurance policy within Careâs stable. The company launched this plan to compete against the likes of HDFC Ergoâs Optima Secure and Niva Bupaâs Reassure. And considering the features on board and the price point at which it sells, Care Supreme can be a very attractive option for a lot of people.\nInsurer Rating\n3.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n4\nWhy\nCare Supreme\nis No.2 on our list\nItâs a comprehensive plan, that offers pretty much every\nhealth insurance add-ons\nyou need, and it is perhaps one of the most affordable plans in this category. Some of the top features include:\nUnlimited Automatic Restoration\n:\nCare Supreme will automatically refill your cover every time you make a claim. So if you have a policy with a cover of â¹10 lakhs and you make a claim totalling â¹2 lakhs, it will restore your cover back to â¹10 lakhs the moment you make the claim.\nNo Bonus clawbacks:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, they will usually clawback a part of the bonus if you ever make a claim. Care Supreme however has no such clause and you will have your bonus intact even if you make multiple claims.\nAffordability:\nThis isnât a feature as much. But itâs still worth noting that the difference in price point between Care Supreme and other similar plans is substantial. For instance, Optima Secure (our top recommendation) is nearly 30% more expensive when compared to Care Supreme for the profiles listed below.\nPremium comparison\nOptima Secure\nCare Supreme\nMale 28, living in Bangalore\nâ¹12,892\nâ¹7,701\nFamily of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹24,418\nâ¹14,357\nCouple of an advanced age -\nMale 66, Female 63\nNA\nâ¹62,210\nRead our full comparison report of\nCare Supreme vs HDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThere is a 4-year waiting period for pre-existing diseases and the only way to cut this down is to buy separate add-ons. Thereâs also another insurer-specific reason why we arenât ranking this plan higher. The claim settlement and complaint numbers for Care arenât that amazing.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE!

Also, Reassure 2.0 builds on the success of Reassure by offering 3 variants of the same plan with extremely comprehensive features at very competitive price points. For the purpose of this list, we are considering the Platinum variant of Reassure 2.0 which sits right between the\nBronze\nvariant and the\nTitanium\nvariant.\nInsurer Rating\n3.2\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.8\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Reassure 2.0 is third on our list\nIt is one of the best policies in its class. It's economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits at a very attractive price point. Hereâs a select few features that we like:\nForever\nRestoration\n:\nYour cover is restored in full the moment you make a claim. And you will have the extra cover throughout your policy term. Also, the restored sum will be added on top of your existing cover and you can claim the full amount (what's left of your base cover and the restored sum) while making a claim.\nAge lock benefit:\nYour premiums will not increase until you make a claim. However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nCarry Forward Bonus:\nEvery year the policy will calculate the unutilized base cover and transfer it to the next year. So if you started with â¹10 lakhs and you made a claim totaling â¹2 lakhs, the remaining â¹8 lakhs will be added to your cover next year and you will have â¹18 lakhs (â¹10 lakhs base cover + â¹8 Lakhs unutilized base cover + bonus) for the next year.\nReassure\nReassure 2.0\nForever Restoration\nAge Lock Benefit\nCarry Forward Bonus\nPremiums for Family of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹21,306\nâ¹19,560\nRead our full comparison report of\nNiva Bupa ReAssure vs Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThereâs nothing to complain about the features. But there are a few issues with the insurer. After the change in management (Max Bupa to Niva Bupa), we have seen a general rise in the amount of complaints. Our own experience working with the insurer on the claim settlement process has left us a bit frustrated. So we canât possibly place them any higher despite the attractive price point and the industry-first features on hand.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE! Book a call now. Limited slots available.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\n4\nAditya Birla Activ Fit Health Insurance\nAditya Birla\nmakes our list at number 4 because most people we tend to fall between the ages of 18 and 45. And this policy is designed specifically for them. It offers significant discounts if youâre healthy, it has no outrageous restrictions, a very good restoration benefit, supercharged bonus feature and it sells at a very attractive price point.\nInsurer Rating\n3.8\nProduct Feature Rating\n3.5\nAffordability\n4.6\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Aditya Birla Activ Fit takes the 4th spot\nAs we noted already itâs a comprehensive policy and it offers some very nice benefits for people who keep healthy:\nUpfront good health discount:\nYou get an upfront 10% discount on your first policy premium by simply undergoing a successful health assessment.\n100% Binge Refill:\nYour cover will be restored in full every time you make a claim. It offers unlimited restoration.\nMaternity and OPD Coverage:\nYou also get some coverage for\nmaternity-related expenses\nand\noutpatient consultations\n. And while we donât usually recommend these features (since it can burn a hole in your pocket), Aditya Bira offers all of this and more without asking you to pay a bomb.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nWhile the product features are decent and the insurer does okay on most fronts, the maximum entry age for the product is capped at 45 years. So if youâre older than 45 you canât buy this policy, which could be frustrating for those who are above the ages of 45.\n5\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\nBajaj Allianz\nHealth Guard Gold makes our list at no 5. The plan does what you would expect from a comprehensive health policy. Itâs not very expensive. And Bajaj Allianz has been posting very respectable claim settlement numbers so far. All things considered, this is a solid plan from a solid company.\nInsurer Rating\n4\nProduct Feature Rating\n3\nAffordability\n4\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\ntakes the 5th spot\nAs we noted earlier, itâs important to look at product features. But itâs even more important to evaluate the insurer. And when we compare Bajaj Allianzâs claim settlement numbers over the last 3 years against other insurers on this list, you will see why this is one of our top 5 recommendations.\nClaim Settlement Ratios\nBajaj Allianz\nAditya Birla\nCare\nHDFC Ergo\nNiva Bupa\n2020-2021\n94.5%\n89.3%\n95.2%\n97%\n90.7%\n2021-2022\n90.8%\n93.7%\n87%\n100%\n90.8%\n2022-2023\n96.8%\n95.9%\n90%\n95.5%\n90.5%\n2023-2024\n95%\n95%\n90%\n98%\n91%\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nAll the other products that make our list offer significant protection by way of extending features like unlimited restoration, supercharged bonus features and unique benefits that you may not find anywhere else. The problem with Health Guard Gold is that it does what you expect it do, but there arenât any shiny features to boast of. So that should explain why we didnât place the plan higher on the list.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, weâve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

So weâve taken into consideration several operational and financial metrics, like claim settlement numbers, track record, and solvency ratios to rank every health insurance company in India.\nWe then took each product and\ncompared\ntheir features. Now bear in mind that most insurance companies will have a basic affordable product, a comprehensive product, and a premium product. The basic product doesnât offer a lot of protection. And the premium products are too expensive and have features that often donât add a lot of value for most people. So while compiling this list weâve only considered comprehensive products that offer significant protection while not burning a hole in your pocket.\nWith that introduction out of the way, letâs look at the top health insurance plans in a little more detail.\nBest Health Insurance Plans\n1\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure Health Insurance\nHDFC Ergo\nOptima Secure takes the top rank this year. It was introduced to replace the companyâs best-selling product -\nOptima Restore\n. In just 2 years since its launch, it has done just that â exceeding expectations from all corners and emerging as our top recommendation for the best health insurance plan for the year 2024.\nInsurer Rating\n4.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n3.5\nFinal Rating\n4.2\nWhy\nOptima Secure\nis our top recommendation\nOptima Secure is an extremely comprehensive policy. It has no room rent restrictions, no\nco-pay clause\n, covers\nAyush treatments\nand has reasonable\nwaiting periods\nfor\npre-existing diseases\n. It also has a bunch of industry-first features that will excite a lot of people.\nSecure Benefit:\nSecure benefit instantly doubles your cover the moment you buy the policy. So for instance, if you buy a a policy with a sum insured of â¹10 lakhs, you get the â¹10 lakhs as base cover and an additional â¹10 lakhs as âSecureâ benefit. Effectively you get double the cover without having to pay more.\nProtect Benefit:\nUsually, insurers donât cover non-medical expenses that could include things like bandages, syringes, gloves, and masks. Even if they do cover it, they ask you to pay extra. But Optima Secure covers these expenses at no additional cost.\nPlus Benefit:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, Optima Secure has completely remodeled the bonus feature and is now offering 50% bonus cover every year irrespective of whether you made a claim. The bonus could go as high as 100% if you renew your policy for 2 consecutive years.\nOn a stand-alone basis, these features may not mean much. But when you compare it against Optima Restore, youâll see why this is a huge leap.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

So if affordability is a concern, itâs best to look at other plans on this list.\n2\nCare Supreme Health Insurance\nCare\nSupreme is second on our list as it is now the best-selling health insurance policy within Careâs stable. The company launched this plan to compete against the likes of HDFC Ergoâs Optima Secure and Niva Bupaâs Reassure. And considering the features on board and the price point at which it sells, Care Supreme can be a very attractive option for a lot of people.\nInsurer Rating\n3.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n4\nWhy\nCare Supreme\nis No.2 on our list\nItâs a comprehensive plan, that offers pretty much every\nhealth insurance add-ons\nyou need, and it is perhaps one of the most affordable plans in this category. Some of the top features include:\nUnlimited Automatic Restoration\n:\nCare Supreme will automatically refill your cover every time you make a claim. So if you have a policy with a cover of â¹10 lakhs and you make a claim totalling â¹2 lakhs, it will restore your cover back to â¹10 lakhs the moment you make the claim.\nNo Bonus clawbacks:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, they will usually clawback a part of the bonus if you ever make a claim. Care Supreme however has no such clause and you will have your bonus intact even if you make multiple claims.\nAffordability:\nThis isnât a feature as much. But itâs still worth noting that the difference in price point between Care Supreme and other similar plans is substantial. For instance, Optima Secure (our top recommendation) is nearly 30% more expensive when compared to Care Supreme for the profiles listed below.\nPremium comparison\nOptima Secure\nCare Supreme\nMale 28, living in Bangalore\nâ¹12,892\nâ¹7,701\nFamily of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹24,418\nâ¹14,357\nCouple of an advanced age -\nMale 66, Female 63\nNA\nâ¹62,210\nRead our full comparison report of\nCare Supreme vs HDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThere is a 4-year waiting period for pre-existing diseases and the only way to cut this down is to buy separate add-ons. Thereâs also another insurer-specific reason why we arenât ranking this plan higher. The claim settlement and complaint numbers for Care arenât that amazing.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE!

Also, Reassure 2.0 builds on the success of Reassure by offering 3 variants of the same plan with extremely comprehensive features at very competitive price points. For the purpose of this list, we are considering the Platinum variant of Reassure 2.0 which sits right between the\nBronze\nvariant and the\nTitanium\nvariant.\nInsurer Rating\n3.2\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.8\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Reassure 2.0 is third on our list\nIt is one of the best policies in its class. It's economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits at a very attractive price point. Hereâs a select few features that we like:\nForever\nRestoration\n:\nYour cover is restored in full the moment you make a claim. And you will have the extra cover throughout your policy term. Also, the restored sum will be added on top of your existing cover and you can claim the full amount (what's left of your base cover and the restored sum) while making a claim.\nAge lock benefit:\nYour premiums will not increase until you make a claim. However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nCarry Forward Bonus:\nEvery year the policy will calculate the unutilized base cover and transfer it to the next year. So if you started with â¹10 lakhs and you made a claim totaling â¹2 lakhs, the remaining â¹8 lakhs will be added to your cover next year and you will have â¹18 lakhs (â¹10 lakhs base cover + â¹8 Lakhs unutilized base cover + bonus) for the next year.\nReassure\nReassure 2.0\nForever Restoration\nAge Lock Benefit\nCarry Forward Bonus\nPremiums for Family of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹21,306\nâ¹19,560\nRead our full comparison report of\nNiva Bupa ReAssure vs Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThereâs nothing to complain about the features. But there are a few issues with the insurer. After the change in management (Max Bupa to Niva Bupa), we have seen a general rise in the amount of complaints. Our own experience working with the insurer on the claim settlement process has left us a bit frustrated. So we canât possibly place them any higher despite the attractive price point and the industry-first features on hand.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

Limited slots available.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\n4\nAditya Birla Activ Fit Health Insurance\nAditya Birla\nmakes our list at number 4 because most people we tend to fall between the ages of 18 and 45. And this policy is designed specifically for them. It offers significant discounts if youâre healthy, it has no outrageous restrictions, a very good restoration benefit, supercharged bonus feature and it sells at a very attractive price point.\nInsurer Rating\n3.8\nProduct Feature Rating\n3.5\nAffordability\n4.6\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Aditya Birla Activ Fit takes the 4th spot\nAs we noted already itâs a comprehensive policy and it offers some very nice benefits for people who keep healthy:\nUpfront good health discount:\nYou get an upfront 10% discount on your first policy premium by simply undergoing a successful health assessment.\n100% Binge Refill:\nYour cover will be restored in full every time you make a claim. It offers unlimited restoration.\nMaternity and OPD Coverage:\nYou also get some coverage for\nmaternity-related expenses\nand\noutpatient consultations\n. And while we donât usually recommend these features (since it can burn a hole in your pocket), Aditya Bira offers all of this and more without asking you to pay a bomb.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nWhile the product features are decent and the insurer does okay on most fronts, the maximum entry age for the product is capped at 45 years. So if youâre older than 45 you canât buy this policy, which could be frustrating for those who are above the ages of 45.\n5\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\nBajaj Allianz\nHealth Guard Gold makes our list at no 5. The plan does what you would expect from a comprehensive health policy. Itâs not very expensive. And Bajaj Allianz has been posting very respectable claim settlement numbers so far. All things considered, this is a solid plan from a solid company.\nInsurer Rating\n4\nProduct Feature Rating\n3\nAffordability\n4\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\ntakes the 5th spot\nAs we noted earlier, itâs important to look at product features. But itâs even more important to evaluate the insurer. And when we compare Bajaj Allianzâs claim settlement numbers over the last 3 years against other insurers on this list, you will see why this is one of our top 5 recommendations.\nClaim Settlement Ratios\nBajaj Allianz\nAditya Birla\nCare\nHDFC Ergo\nNiva Bupa\n2020-2021\n94.5%\n89.3%\n95.2%\n97%\n90.7%\n2021-2022\n90.8%\n93.7%\n87%\n100%\n90.8%\n2022-2023\n96.8%\n95.9%\n90%\n95.5%\n90.5%\n2023-2024\n95%\n95%\n90%\n98%\n91%\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nAll the other products that make our list offer significant protection by way of extending features like unlimited restoration, supercharged bonus features and unique benefits that you may not find anywhere else. The problem with Health Guard Gold is that it does what you expect it do, but there arenât any shiny features to boast of. So that should explain why we didnât place the plan higher on the list.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, weâve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

There are no restrictions on the kind of room you can pick, you get a healthy loyalty benefit (50% increase in sum insured on every renewal until 100% of sum insured), and the heavily talked about Secure benefit. All things put together, you can get 3X the cover you originally paid for, once the loyalty benefit is fully accumulated. In many ways, this is a worthy successor to Optima Restore.\nBuy now\nPolicy Wording\nView Policy Brochure\nWhat's good here?\nð\nSpecial Mention\nSecure Benefit\nYou get 2x the cover you pay for: When you buy a policy with a cover of 10 lakhs for instance, you are automatically entitled to a cover of 20 Lakhs starting from day 1.\nYou get 2x the cover you pay for: When you buy a policy with a cover of 10 lakhs for instance, you are automatically entitled to a cover of 20 Lakhs starting from day 1.\nYouâll never have to split the bill\nThe insurer will bear the entire cost of treatment (up to the sum insured). You wonât have to pay a single penny. Meaning this policy has no co-payment.\nLearn More\nYou always have full cover irrespective of the disease\nNo funny business here. If your insurer hasnât explicitly stated they wonât cover a certain illness, you can claim the full amount up to the sum insured, irrespective of the disease youâre dealing with. Meaning this policy doesn't impose the dreaded disease wise sub-limits.\nLearn More\nGood Restoration Benefit\nEven after you claim part of the cover on one occasion, you will have 100% of the cover restored, so that you can use this benefit in the event you have to endure multiple hospitalizations.\nLearn More\nSpecial bonus for renewing the policy\nYour sum insured increases by 50% each year irrespective of your claim status in the current year. However, the sum insured keeps increasing as long as the Loyalty benefit sum insured reaches 100% of the sum insured.\nLearn More\nFull coverage even if you are forced to hospitalize at home\nThe insurer will bear the costs even if you are hospitalized at home due to a condition or the hospital running out of beds. In insurance lingo, they call this a policy with domiciliary cover.\nLearn More\nYou can pick any room you like\nShared room, single room, deluxe room or any room thatâs available. The insurer wonât nitpick on your choice of room since the policy has no restrictions on room rent.\nLearn More\nPre & Post hospitalization expenses covered\nNo worries if the doctor had to run a host of diagnostic tests before or after hospitalizing you. The insurer has your back. They will cover this amount in full for a pretty reasonable duration -\n60\ndays before you are hospitalized and\n180\ndays after discharge. This includes the cost of medication by the way.\nLearn More\nDay Care treatments covered\nIf youâre hospitalized for less than 24 hours in lieu of a minor procedure, then the insurer will cover these costs too. Think dialysis, chemotherapy or minor surgeries.\nLearn More\nFree Health Checkups\nIf youâre planning on getting a full body checkup every year just to make sure youâre in fine working condition, the insurer will cover the costs. (Note: This is not available for plan with 5L aggregate deductible.)\nLearn More\nCovers Alternative Medicine\nThink of getting Ayurvedic, Homeopathic or other alternative treatments to cure an illness? Your insurer will cover you fully, up to the sum insured.\nLearn More\nWhat's okay here?\nReasonable waiting period for pre-existing diseases\nIf youâre already dealing with diabetes, cardiovascular problems or any such illnesses, the insurer will cover all costs arising out of these pre-existing problems after you wait for 3 years.\nLearn More\nIf youâre already dealing with diabetes, cardiovascular problems or any such illnesses, the insurer will cover all costs arising out of these pre-existing problems after you wait for 3 years.\nLearn More\nAdd-on\ns\nHospital Daily Cash\nThe insurer pays a lumpsum by adding a fixed sum (daily cash) every day until the day of discharge so you can deal with any potential loss in income during this time. The money will be reimbursed to you after you submit the required documents post-discharge, and while this looks like a neat benefit to have, we donât recommend it since the benefit doesnât compensate for the extra premium you pay.\nUnlimited Restore\nUnlimited Restore will restore your cover in full every time a claim is settled.\nIndividual Personal Accident\nThe add-on pays a portion of the cover amount to customers in the event the policy holder had to deal with deaths, injuries, and partial or total disability resulting from an accident.\nCritical Illness\nYouâll be entitled to receive the full cover once youâre diagnosed with any of the 51 critical diseases listed in the policy brochure. However, since the premiums here keep changing as you grow older, it may make more financial sense to buy a critical illness cover with term plans at better rates.\nAggregate Deductible\nIf you ever have to make a claim, then youâll be expected to pay a sum before insurance company settles the claim. This amount is called the deductible. So if you want to buy a policy at a better price, you can opt to pay a higher deductible i.e. you can pay lower premiums by offering to pay a sum (a deductible) when a claim comes up.\nOptima Well-being\nWith this add-on, each insured member can avail of unlimited tele and in-clinic consultations with General Physicians from network-partnered facilities. Additionally, one can avail of free home sample collection and discounts on tests taken from partnered facilities. They can also take unlimited online fitness classes, counselling sessions for mental health, diet and nutrition from partnered facilities.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDoes Optima Secure have waiting periods?\nYes. Optima Secure imposes 3 kinds of waiting periods -\n30-Day Waiting Period:\nHospitalizations wonât be covered for the first 30 days of the policy unless itâs an accident.\nSpecific Illness Waiting Period:\nThereâs a 2-year waiting period for a list of diseases which is a mandate before you can start claiming.\nPre-Existing Disease Waiting Period:\nThere's a 3-year waiting period for any pre-existing disease you may have while buying the policy.\nDoes Optima Secure have room rent restrictions?\nDoes Optima Secure offer a restoration benefit?\nDoes Optima Secure cover AYUSH treatments?\nDoes Optima Secure offer a bonus?\nDoes Optima Secure offer maternity benefits?\nDoes Optima Secure offer international coverage?\nDoes Optima Secure offer dental protection?\nDoes Optima Secure offer coverage for outpatient consultations?\nHow are the premiums calculated for Optima Secure?\nCan I avail myself of a discount on Optima Secure?\nDoes Optima Secure have entry and exit restrictions?\nHow do you file a claim if you have Optima Secure?\nWhat documents do I need to file a claim if I have Optima Secure?\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

    "title": "Best Maternity Health Insurance Plans in India (2024)",
    "text": "3 January 2023\n•\nHealth Insurance\nBest Health Insurance Plan For Expecting Couples (Maternity Insurance Plans)\nTable of Contents\nStarting a family is one of the most exciting and\njoy\nful times in anyone's life. However, it also comes with a huge financial responsibility, especially regarding the expenses related to pregnancy and childbirth. This is precisely why having a\ngood health insurance policy\nthat covers maternity is essential nowadays.\nWhat is Maternity Coverage in Health Insurance Plans?\nMaternity coverage in health insurance\nis nothing but your insurance company covering the cost of childbirth. It’s a safety net designed to ease the financial burden associated with maternity care. This ensures you can focus on what matters most without worrying about medical expenses.\nBut at the same time, this doesn’t mean your insurer covers all maternity-related expenses. There are specific inclusions that the insurer covers and\nexclusions\nthat the insurer will not cover. Let’s explore this in detail now.\nWhat is Covered Under Maternity Health Insurance Plans?\nMaternity involves numerous costs\n– when delivering a child, you have to pay for prenatal care, regular check-ups, ultrasounds, and other necessary tests to monitor the health of the mother and the baby. You should also pay for the postnatal care, which includes follow-up visits and treatments after the delivery, not to mention the actual delivery cost, which can vary significantly depending on whether it's a regular delivery or a C-section.\nAll of these costs associated with delivering a child are called maternity expenses, and depending on the insurer and policy, they cover some or most of these costs.\nHeads Up: It takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyze a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.\nThis is why we propose a better alternative - taking a 30-minute FREE consultation with Ditto’s certified advisors. We have a spam-free guarantee, and we’ll never push you to buy a plan. Don’t delay this - we have limited slots every day, so\nbook a quick call here\nbefore they run out.\nThis begs the question –\nWhat are the Best Maternity Health Insurance Plans?\nAditya Birla Activ Fit Preferred\nAditya Birla Activ Fit Preferred is explicitly crafted for young adults, considering the discounts offered during insurance renewals if you are healthy (as diagnosed in their Health Assessment Program). This is a decent pick with 2 variants - Plus (individual, multi-individual and family floater) and Preferred (family floater), extending exhaustive sum insured ranging from ₹1 lakh to ₹1 crore.\nThe policy offers maternity coverage perks, multiple premium discounts if you stay healthy during renewals, and add-ons like - Super No-Claim Bonus, OPD coverage, Reduction in maternity waiting period, Travel Protect Cover, Premiums Waiver Cover, EMI Protection Cover, and Consumables Coverage.\nTata Medicare Premier\nTata Medicare Premier is a great policy, considering it covers most bases and then goes beyond the traditional feature set to offer maternity coverage, coverage for international treatments, and even pay for outpatient consultations. All of these are subject to certain conditions of course, but if you are looking for comprehensive coverage, very few policies can beat this. The only caveat is that it is an expensive policy.\nICICI Lombard Elevate\nICICI Lombard Elevate is an excellent health insurance policy on paper – it has unlimited coverage once in the policy’s lifetime, has a wide range of add-ons, global coverage and even has maternity cover. . However, it has limitations, such as sub-limits on specific treatments, a nominal renewal bonus, and room rent restrictions on the base plan. All in all, this is a decent health insurance plan if you’re looking for coverage for your family.\nNiva Bupa Aspire\nNiva Bupa has a vast network of over 10k hospitals and offers add-ons such as teleconsultations, coverage of pre-existing diseases, consumables, etc. It also has a unique feature where your premiums will not increase due to age until you make a claim. However, as an insurer, we feel Niva Bupa can have better metrics than its peers. We still feel this is a decent choice if you’re looking for cashless coverage.\nStar Super Star\nSTAR Super Star\noffers customisable health insurance with features like add-ons for childbirth, newborn expenses, and Assisted Reproduction Treatment (ART), as well as a premium freeze benefit that helps save money over time. It has no room rent restrictions, no copayment, and provides full coverage with no disease-specific sub-limits (except for maternity). With over 20 add-ons available, the plan is highly flexible. However, the insurer’s below-average claim settlement ratio and operational inefficiencies may affect claim processing and customer service, making it a mixed choice for those seeking a personalised plan.\nShould You Buy a Maternity Health Insurance Plan?\nWhether or not you should have maternity coverage by your policy is not a straightforward “Yes” or “No”. It has numerous nuances that vary from policy to policy and has various advantages and disadvantages that might affect some people more than others. Here, we have compiled a list of some advantages and disadvantages that are common across most policies:\nCTA\nPros of Maternity Health Insurance Plans\na. Covers maternity and post-maternity costs:\nYour insurance policy's maternity coverage ensures you are financially protected against childbirth costs. If at all you make out-of-pocket expenses, this ensures that it is the least.\nb. Internal congenital disorders:\nSometimes, babies may have disorders that affect them right from birth. These are called congenital disorders and are classified into internal and external congenital disorders. External disorders, such as cleft lip and club foot, are easily visible to the eye.\nInternal congenital disorders are not easily visible, such as heart disorders or Down Syndrome.\nEarlier, insurers did not cover congenital disorders, but nowadays, if a policy covers maternity, internal congenital disorders are covered.\nc. The newborn is covered right from Day 1:\nMany maternity policies will also cover the newborn right from day one. This ensures that vaccinations or other childcare-related expenses (within the policy’s scope) are also covered.\n2. Cons of Maternity Health Insurance Plans\na. Waiting period:\nOne significant downside of maternity policies is the\nwaiting period\n. In most policies, even if you purchase a policy that covers maternity expenses, the waiting period will be activated only after you get married and add your spouse. Keeping this in mind, choose a plan with the shortest waiting period.\nb. Both spouses must opt for maternity coverage:\nEven though the husband will never use maternity coverage, insurers mandate that both spouses purchase it. However, there are exceptions, such as Niva Bupa Aspire, where you can purchase the maternity add-on before you are married and add your spouse. But it is important to note that this is not the norm.\nc. Sub-Limits:\nHealth insurance policies that cover maternity expenses are notorious for having\nsub-limits\non their coverage. Ensure the policy has no sub-limit or, at least, a good sub-limit covers all the anticipated costs.\nd. High premiums compared to the same plan without maternity:\nInsurers usually charge a higher premium if a policy covers maternity.  This is because they anticipate a larger payout if a couple opts for maternity coverage. Ensure that the cost differential between the policies is not very high.\nThings to Remember while Purchasing the Best Maternity Health Insurance Plans\nCost Comparison:\nAs mentioned earlier, maternity health insurance plans often have higher premiums than standard health insurance policies.\nNewborn Coverage:\nSome policies cover the newborn right from Day 1, but others cover the newborn only after 90 days. You need to be aware of this waiting period because if the infant develops an unfortunate condition within 90 days, which happens to be a crucial period for newborns, the insurer will only cover it if they have coverage from Day 1.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, we’ve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

It offers policies across motor, travel, health and other sectors. It recently acquired Apollo Munich Health Insurance company and now has the largest network of cashless hospitals in the country. It's health insurance policies offers a coverage of 3 lacs to 75 lacs.\nClaim Settlement Ratio -Â\n98\n%Â\nÂ (average of last 3 years)\nNetwork Hospitals -\n13,000+\nHDFC Ergo Health insurance plans\n1\nEnergy Gold\nIf you're diabetic or suffering from Hypertension, then Energy is for you, considering the fact that the insurer covers all complication arising out of  these chronic diseases from Day 1. However, if you aren't diabetic maybe you could look at the other options since this policy is fairly expensive.\nView Policy\n3\nEnergy Silver\nIf you're diabetic or suffering from Hypertension, then Energy is for you, considering the fact that the insurer covers all complication arising out of  these chronic diseases from Day 1. However, if you aren't diabetic maybe you could look at the other options since this policy is fairly expensive.\nView Policy\n5\nmyHealth Medisure Super Top-up\nWhile it is a decent super top up plan, you don't really get a disproportionately large cover with myHealth Medisure. The plan allows you to top up your base policy only by about 20 lakhs tops. So if you are ever hospitalized for a rare condition, then the cover might not suffice.\nView Policy\n7\nmyHealth Suraksha Gold\nmy Health Suraksha Gold policy covers most use cases. You get a large cover (7.5 lakhs-15 lakhs) You won't have to worry about hidden T&C's. You get really comprehensive coverage. A host of benefits to go along with it. And it's a pretty good policy overall. No complaints!\nView Policy\n9\nOptima Lite\nHDFC Ergoâs new policy, Optima Lite, is a new variant of Optima Secure Family and is supposed to be an affordable alternative for Optima Secure. \nNow, while the policy does have some pros in the form of unlimited restoration features, no disease-wise sub-limits, and other basic features, the plan has quite a few caveats, too. \nWhether you are talking about room rent restrictions, limited access to the plan (not available in Tier 1 cities), low in-built bonus (only 10% up to 100%), or inadequate coverage (5 lakhs or 7.5 lakhs) - the Optima Lite plan has it all. \nIn a nutshell, the planâs affordability comes at the cost of its lack of comprehensiveness. You might want to figure out if this is a trade-off you wantÂ toÂ sideÂ with.\nView Policy\n11\nmyHealth Suraksha Silver\nmy Health Suraksha Silver might only offer you a cover totalling 5 lakhs. But make no mistake, it offers pretty extensive coverage. It has decent benefits. It doesn't include any absurd conditions. And the only other policies within the HDFC Ergo stable, that offer a higher cover include Health Suraksha Gold and Platinum.\nView Policy\n13\nOptima Secure\nOptima Secure is a great policy. There are no restrictions on the kind of room you can pick, you get a healthy loyalty benefit (50% increase in sum insured on every renewal until 100% of sum insured), and the heavily talked about Secure benefit. All things put together, you can get 3X the cover you originally paid for, once the loyalty benefit is fully accumulated. In many ways, this is a worthy successor to Optima Restore.\nView Policy\n15\nOptima Secure Global\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure Global is the second most expensive product within HDFC Ergoâs stable. It offers pretty much all the benefits offered by Optima Secure (HDFC Ergoâs best-selling insurance policy) and also covers international emergency treatments for 45 days per trip (excluding pre/post expenses). If youâre a routine traveller outside India, this could make more sense than Optima Secure. Otherwise, you can opt for other alternatives, considering the premiums youâll be expected to pay here.\nView Policy\n2\nOptima Restore\nOptima Restore is one of the most popular products within Apollo Munich's stable (now HDFC Ergo). And for good reasons. It covers most bases. It's economical. It doesn't have any unsavoury conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits that are particularly useful. All in all, a solid pick.\nView Policy\n4\nEquiCover\nThe EquiCover Plan from HDFC Ergo is a basic plan with a unique target audience - potential policyholders with disabilities (40% or more) & HIV/AIDS. Now, while this is a commendable stance from the stable of HDFC Ergo, the EquiCover policy has a long list of caveats, including - Room restriction (1% for Room, 2% for ICU) - 20% mandatory co-payment, no restoration perk, no bonus, no domiciliary coverage, sub-limits on cataracts coverage & modern treatment, and an extensive waiting Period: (2 years for Pre-Existing Disability and 3 years for PEDs other than  HIV/AIDS and Disability). All of this, makes EquiCover a unique and yet not-recommendable policy, unless this comes off as a last resort.\nView Policy\n6\nHealth Wallet\nLike most of the plans from the HDFC Ergo stable, the Health Wallet policy is a great pick, too. The plan is comprehensive and extends multiple features; however, one unique perk deserves a special mention - Reserve Benefit. Under this feature, you are covered for OPD services like diagnostic tests, vaccinations, pharmacy, dental expenses, special health foods & supplements and consultations with a medical practitioner, physiotherapist, dietician, speech therapist, and psychologist. The coverage cap varies as per the base sum insured. \nUnfortunately, this plan has a drawback - the in-built restoration perk is only available in case if you completely exhausted your cover amount and can be used to cover for the treatment of various ailments.\nView Policy\n8\nmyHealth Suraksha Platinum\nmy Health Suraksha Platinum is a premium policy. And it shows. You get a massive cover (20 lakhs-75 lakhs). No outrageous conditions. Comprehensive coverage. And extra bonus cover compared to the less expensive HDFC ERGO Gold. In summary, it really is Platinum grade.\nView Policy\n10\nOptima Secure Global Plus\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure Global Plus is the most expensive product within HDFC Ergoâs stable. It offers pretty much all the benefits offered by Optima Secure (HDFC Ergoâs best-selling insurance policy) and also covers both planned and emergency treatments abroad including pre/post hospitalization expenses. If youâre a routine traveller outside India, this could make more sense than Optima Secure. Otherwise, you can opt for other alternatives, considering the premiums youâll be expectedÂ toÂ payÂ here.\nView Policy\n12\nmyHealth Koti Suraksha\nKoti Suraksha offers you a grand cover of 1 Crore unless you have a kidney stone, or a benign tumour, or some such similar complication at which point they will only offer you 75,000 in total. In other words it's a great plan for those who want to cover the rare diseases that can weigh heavily on your pockets.\nView Policy\n14\nOptima Super Secure\nOptima Super Secure works exactly like Optima Secure. There are no restrictions on the kind of room you can pick, you get a healthy loyalty benefit (50% increase in Sum Insured on every renewal until 100% of Sum Insured), and the heavily talked about Secure benefit. The only difference is that within the secure benefit you get 3x the cover you pay for (as opposed to 2x in Optima Secure). And it's only slightly expensive, available on a 3 pay option. Meaning you have to commit for 3 years minimum when you buy the policy.\nView Policy\nHDFC Ergo Health insurance claim process\nHDFC Ergo\nclaims can be of different types based on the hospital in which you are getting the treatment. If itâs part of\nHDFC Ergo\n's network hospitals, you can get a âCashless claimâ in which insurance company directly pays the bills to the hospital. But if your choice of hospital is not part of their network, then you have to pay the bills and apply for reimbursement claim. Hereâs a brief process for both types of claims:\nCashless Claims\n1\nInform the Hospital Desk\nAll network hospitals have an insurance desk. You can submit your policy copy (even soft copy works), ID proof, initial diagnosis report and the insurance desk will request the insurance company for âpre-authorizationâ. In case of planned treatments, you need to do this process 2 days before hospitalization\n2\nInsurerâs decision\nBased on the provided documents, insurance company approve the claim and the hospital will start the treatment and they will co-ordinate with insurer for the treatment costs. In case of Cashless claim rejection, you can still go ahead with the treatment. In this case, you will need to pay the bills initially and can file for a reimbursement claim later\n3\nDischarge\nIf your cashless claim is approved, at the time of discharge, the insurance company will do the final settlement with the hospital and once that is sorted, you are good to go.\nReimbursement Claims\n1\nInform the insurance company\nFor any planned treatments, you need to inform the insurance company 2 days before hospitalisation. In case of emergency, you can inform within 24 hours of admission. Insurance company will acknowledge the intimation.\n2\nHospitalization\nYou need to submit a insurance claim form along with original copies of hospital bills, doctor consultation reports, and diagonstic reports.\n3\nFile the claim\nWithin 30 days post discharge, you can initiate the claim online or at any of the registered offices of the insurance company. You need to fill a claim form and attach all the reports and bills.\n4\nInsurerâs decision\nBased on the claim form and submitted documents, insurance company will settle the claims as per policy terms and conditions.\nHDFC Ergo Health Insurance Renewal\nFirstly, if youâve purchased the policy online, youâll always receive an intimation e-mail from the insurer around 30 days before the renewal date. The e-mail will have a renewal link that will directly take you to the page where you can make the payment and check policy details. And itâs done. Youâll receive the policy document via e-mail.\nHowever, in case you choose to do it on your own, hereâs what you need to do:\n1\nVisit the website\nVisit the HDFC Ergo website and then go to the Renewal section\nhere\n.\n2\nEnter details\nYouâd be asked to provide your current policy number which you can find in the policy soft copy. You may as well be asked to enter your mobile number, email ID, Date of Birth or policy expiry date.\n3\nReview and edit the policy details\nNext, youâll be able to see details of your new policy and the renewal premium you need to pay. Also, youâll be given the option to make some changes related to sum insured, existing covered members, etc.\n4\nComplete the payment and itâs done\nOnce you confirm the details, youâll be directed to the payment gateway. Once the payment is complete, youâll receive your new policy soft copy via e-mail.\nFew things to consider when renewing your HDFC Ergo health insurance policy\nIf you want to increase your Sum Insured, now is the time. You canât do it anytime during the year.\nIf you didnât make a claim in the past year, make sure you have been given a no-claim bonus if your policy offers it.\nIf you want to add members like your spouse or kids, you have the option to do so only at the time of renewal. So do give this a thought.\nCustomer Reviews\nView All\nExcellent experience\nI had a rhinoplasty surgery a few months ago and hdfc ergo team provided me with all the help they could. I spent not a single rupee for my surgery. My claim was filed within an hour and I got the reimbursement the same day.

Its economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits including forever restoration (as described below). Unfortunately, the aggressive pricing means that Niva Bupa has the tough task of paying out ever larger claims while also managing to keep prices low. Can they do it? We don't know.\nPolicy Wording\nView Policy Brochure\nWhat's good here?\nYouâll never have to split the bill\nThe insurer will bear the entire cost of treatment (up to the sum insured). You wonât have to pay a single penny. Meaning this policy has no co-payment.\nLearn More\nThe insurer will bear the entire cost of treatment (up to the sum insured). You wonât have to pay a single penny. Meaning this policy has no co-payment.\nLearn More\nYou can pick any room you like\nShared room, single room, deluxe room or any room thatâs available. The insurer wonât nitpick on your choice of room since the policy has no restrictions on room rent.\nLearn More\nPre & Post hospitalization expenses covered\nNo worries if the doctor had to run a host of diagnostic tests before or after hospitalizing you. The insurer has your back. They will cover this amount in full for a pretty reasonable duration -\n60\ndays before you are hospitalized and\n180\ndays after discharge. This includes the cost of medication by the way.\nLearn More\nDay Care treatments covered\nIf youâre hospitalized for less than 24 hours in lieu of a minor procedure, then the insurer will cover these costs too. Think dialysis, chemotherapy or minor surgeries.\nLearn More\nFree Health Checkups\nAvailable from day-1, 500 for every 1L sum insured. Max of 5000 rupees for an individual policy and up-to 10000 in a floater policy\nLearn More\nCovers Alternative Medicine\nThink of getting Ayurvedic, Homeopathic or other alternative treatments to cure an illness? Your insurer will cover you fully, up to the sum insured.\nLearn More\nYou always have full cover irrespective of the disease\nNo funny business here. If your insurer hasnât explicitly stated they wonât cover a certain illness, you can claim the full amount up to the sum insured, irrespective of the disease youâre dealing with. Meaning this policy doesn't impose the dreaded disease wise sub-limits.\nLearn More\nUnlimited Restoration Benefit\nEven after you claim part of the cover on one occasion, you will be allowed to claim the full cover any number of times repeatedly if you are hospitalized in the future. All in the same year by the way!!!\nLearn More\nCarry forward your unutilized cover\nEvery year the policy will calculate the unutilized base cover and transfer it to the next year. So if you started with 10 lakhs and you made a claim totaling 2 lakhs, the remaining 8 lakhs will be added to your cover next year and you will have 18 lakhs (10 lakhs base cover + 8 Lakhs unutilized base cover as bonus) for the next year. This will continue until your cover totals 4x the base sum insured(carry forward unutilized cover up to 3x of base cover).\nLearn More\nFull coverage even if you are forced to hospitalize at home\nThe insurer will bear the costs even if you are hospitalized at home due to a condition or the hospital running out of beds. In insurance lingo, they call this a policy with domiciliary cover.\nLearn More\nWhat's okay here?\nReasonable waiting period for pre-existing diseases\nIf youâre already dealing with diabetes, cardiovascular problems or any such illnesses, the insurer will cover all costs arising out of these pre-existing problems after you wait for 3 years.\nLearn More\nIf youâre already dealing with diabetes, cardiovascular problems or any such illnesses, the insurer will cover all costs arising out of these pre-existing problems after you wait for 3 years.\nLearn More\nAdd-on\ns\nDisease Management\nThis add-on will cut waiting periods to 0 days for the following pre-existing conditions: Hypertension and Diabetes. And if you are currently diagnosed with any of these conditions, it makes sense to opt for this add-on.\nSafeguard +\nWith this add-on, the insurer will increase your cover in line with inflation every year, your bonus amount will not be affected if the claim is less than 1 Lakh in the entire year and you also get extended coverage for generally excluded items like syringes, gloves, PPE kits etc.\nHospital Cash\nWith this add-on, the insurer will hand out Rs. 1000/day, Rs. 2000/day or Rs. 4000/day in cash every day you stay at the hospital subject to certain limits. The cash is expected to replace your income during the course of your hospitalization.\nAggregate Deductible\nIf you ever have to make a claim, then youâll be expected to pay a sum before insurance company settles the claim. This amount is called the deductible. So if you want to buy a policy at a better price, you can opt to pay a higher deductible i.e. you can pay lower premiums by offering to pay a sum (a deductible) when a claim comes up.\nSafeguard\nWith this add-on, the insurer will increase your cover in line with inflation every year, your bonus amount will not be affected if the claim is less than â¹50,000 in the entire year and you also get extended coverage for generally excluded items like syringes, gloves, PPE kits etc.\nAcute Care\nWith this add-on, you get unlimited tele-consultations with Doctors (General Medical Practitioners, Specialists & Super Specialists) along with coverage for pharmacy and diagnostics up to a certain limit.\nPersonal Accident cover\nWith this add-on, the insurance company will payout a lumpsum of 5x your sum insured, in case the proposer of the policy passes away in an accident. The payout will be made subject to a cap of 1CR in total.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+ have waiting periods?\nYes. ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+ imposes 3 kinds of waiting periods -\n30-Day Waiting Period:\nHospitalizations wonât be covered for the first 30 days of the policy unless itâs an accident.\nSpecific Illness Waiting Period:\nThereâs a 2-year waiting period for a list of diseases which is a mandate before you can start claiming.\nPre-Existing Disease Waiting Period:\nThere's a 3-year waiting period for any pre-existing disease you may have while buying the policy.\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+ have room rent restrictions?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+ offer a restoration benefit?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+ cover AYUSH treatments?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+ offer a bonus?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+ offer maternity benefits?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+ offer international coverage?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+ offer dental protection?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+ offer coverage for outpatient consultations?\nHow are the premiums calculated for ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+?\nCan I avail myself of a discount on ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+?\nDoes ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+ have entry and exit restrictions?\nHow do you file a claim if you have ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+?\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

It offers a wide range of deductible options (5L, 7L, 10L, 15L). Offers comprehensive cover options of upto 95 Lakhs and doesnât impose any restrictions on the kind of room you can pick (which most super top-up policies do).

This variant is comprehensive and is a great pick overall. Apart from the PED waiting period of 3 years, which is a tad bit longer (2 years would have been better) than expected, the plan has no caveats. And while the policy doesn\u0000\u0000ât offer any over-the-top features like maternity or international coverage, it covers all the bases and has nominal restrictions.\nAdditionally, as a couple of unique perks, the policy also offers a Hospital Cash Cover for parents or parents-in-law and an in-built loyalty bonus of 100% to 500%. \nOverall - a solid pick!\nView Policy\n15\nActiv One MAX\nActiv One Max is a variant within the Activ One policy series. This series allows customization over a base plan letting users pick and choose add-ons and Active One Max is the base plan. It includes several notable features, such as an exceptional bonus system and built-in consumable coverage. Additionally, it provides up to a 100% discount on renewal premiums, contingent upon adherence to a designated fitness regimen. If you are looking for an affordable plan with decent features, this could be a pretty good fit even without the customization\nView Policy\n2\nActiv Care Standard\nActiv Care Standard could be a good policy if youâre 55+, with pre-existing complications or if nobody is willing to insure you. However, if you have other alternatives, this policy could be a letdown, considering the policy has some unsavoury conditions including restrictions on room rent. So do read more below.\nView Policy\n4\nActiv Health Platinum Essential\nActiv health platinum essential is fairly economical and it does an okay job. But once you're hospitalized, they'll make you split the bill, they might not offer the full cover for some treatments and they'll make you wait 3 years before covering complications arising out of pre-existing illnesses.\nView Policy\n6\nActiv Fit Plus\nThis plan is specially curated for young audiences who are into fitness. It has special discounts on both first-year premiums and renewal premiums based on medical evaluations or a fitness regime matrix. It also offers online consultations for mental illnesses based on medical evaluation. All in all, it is a good plan with good features, no outrageous conditions, so long as you're under 45.\nView Policy\n8\nActiv One VYTL\nActiv One VYTL is a comprehensive variant within the Activ One policy series. You get all the benefits you get with Active One Max (the base plan) and day-1 coverage for 7 conditions including common lifestyle diseases like Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. You also get coverage for certain diagnostic tests as specified in the application and if you are somebody with a lifestyle condition listed in the policy document, this product could be an excellent fit.\nView Policy\n10\nActiv One NXT\nActiv One NXT is a variant within the Activ One policy series and it is perhaps the least appealing option within the lot. While the base features are pretty okay, you do miss out on a loyalty bonus, which you can find in both Active One Max and Active One Max+. This policy has a pre-existing disease waiting period of 3 years, with the only upside being you get the Super Reload Benefit which essentially means you will 2x the cover you opted for from day 1.\nView Policy\n12\nActiv Assured Diamond\nActiv Assured Diamond is a decent policy. And while it covers most bases, it does have a room rent restriction. This means that if you're looking for a slightly fancy room or the room covered by the policy is not available, you will have to pay a portion of the bill amount.\nView Policy\n14\nActiv Fit Preferred\nThis plan is specially curated for young audiences who are into fitness and it is slightly more robust than its counterpart Activ Fit Plus. It has special discounts on both first-year premiums and renewal premiums based on medical evaluations or a fitness regime matrix. It covers online consultations for mental illnesses based on medical evaluation and it even offers maternity coverage (to a certain extent) on top. All in all, a pretty good plan for people under 45 and those seeking maternity protection.\nView Policy\n16\nActiv One MAX+\nActiv One Max+ is a variant within the Activ One policy series. It includes the base plan with a couple of extra benefits. Within the annual health check up list you will see 2 extra tests and it will cover costs associated with wheelchairs, walkers, hearing aids, etc  if it is deemed medically necessary (with an explicit approval from a doctor). However comparing the costs and the restrictions involved in claiming the extra benefits, perhaps just the base plan i.e. Activ One Max (without the +) becomes a better option.\nView Policy\nAditya Birla Health insurance claim process\nAditya Birla\nclaims can be of different types based on the hospital in which you are getting the treatment. If itâs part of\nAditya Birla\n's network hospitals, you can get a âCashless claimâ in which insurance company directly pays the bills to the hospital. But if your choice of hospital is not part of their network, then you have to pay the bills and apply for reimbursement claim. Hereâs a brief process for both types of claims:\nCashless Claims\n1\nInform the Hospital Desk\nAll network hospitals have an insurance desk. You can submit your policy copy (even soft copy works), ID proof, initial diagnosis report and the insurance desk will request the insurance company for âpre-authorizationâ. In case of planned treatments, you need to do this process 2 days before hospitalization\n2\nInsurerâs decision\nBased on the provided documents, insurance company approve the claim and the hospital will start the treatment and they will co-ordinate with insurer for the treatment costs. In case of Cashless claim rejection, you can still go ahead with the treatment. In this case, you will need to pay the bills initially and can file for a reimbursement claim later\n3\nDischarge\nIf your cashless claim is approved, at the time of discharge, the insurance company will do the final settlement with the hospital and once that is sorted, you are good to go.\nReimbursement Claims\n1\nInform the insurance company\nFor any planned treatments, you need to inform the insurance company 2 days before hospitalisation. In case of emergency, you can inform within 24 hours of admission. Insurance company will acknowledge the intimation.\n2\nHospitalization\nYou need to submit a insurance claim form along with original copies of hospital bills, doctor consultation reports, and diagonstic reports.\n3\nFile the claim\nWithin 30 days post discharge, you can initiate the claim online or at any of the registered offices of the insurance company. You need to fill a claim form and attach all the reports and bills.\n4\nInsurerâs decision\nBased on the claim form and submitted documents, insurance company will settle the claims as per policy terms and conditions.\nAditya Birla Health Insurance Renewal\nFirstly, if youâve purchased the policy online, youâll always receive an intimation e-mail from the insurer around 30 days before the renewal date. The e-mail will have a renewal link that will directly take you to the page where you can make the payment and check policy details. And itâs done. Youâll receive the policy document via e-mail.\nHowever, in case you choose to do it on your own, hereâs what you need to do:\n1\nVisit the website\nVisit the Aditya Birla website and then go to the Renewal section\nhere\n.\n2\nEnter details\nYouâd be asked to provide your current policy number which you can find in the policy soft copy. You may as well be asked to enter your mobile number, email ID, Date of Birth or policy expiry date.\n3\nReview and edit the policy details\nNext, youâll be able to see details of your new policy and the renewal premium you need to pay. Also, youâll be given the option to make some changes related to sum insured, existing covered members, etc.\n4\nComplete the payment and itâs done\nOnce you confirm the details, youâll be directed to the payment gateway. Once the payment is complete, youâll receive your new policy soft copy via e-mail.\nFew things to consider when renewing your Aditya Birla health insurance policy\nIf you want to increase your Sum Insured, now is the time. You canât do it anytime during the year.\nIf you didnât make a claim in the past year, make sure you have been given a no-claim bonus if your policy offers it.\nIf you want to add members like your spouse or kids, you have the option to do so only at the time of renewal. So do give this a thought.\nCustomer Reviews\nView All\nGood Customer Support\nAditya Birlaâs customer service is very fast and responsive.

    "text": "12 January 2023\n•\nHealth Insurance\nAYUSH treatment and its benefits in Health Insurance?\nTable of Contents\nThere’s this age-old saying that Western Medicine cures the symptoms, but Natural Medicine cures the illness.\nLong before modern medicine took over, people relied on natural and holistic treatments to heal their ailments. These treatments, rooted in natural and traditional practices, have stood the test of time and are still prevalent today. With the rising awareness of the side effects of mainstream modern treatments, more and more people, especially senior citizens and people with chronic illnesses, are leaning towards alternative therapies such as\nAYUSH\n.\nTherefore, health insurers also started to cover AYUSH treatments in their policies. But what exactly is AYUSH treatment, what are its advantages and disadvantages, and should you consider opting for it?\nBest Health Insurers\nBest Health Insurance Policies Offering AYUSH Coverage\nCoverage for AYUSH treatments\nHDFC ERGO\nOptima Secure\nUp to the sum insured.\nCare\nSupreme\nUp to the sum insured.\nNiva Bupa\nReAssure 2.0\nUp to the sum insured.\nAditya Birla\nActiv One\nUp to the sum insured.\nBajaj Allianz\nHealth Guard Gold\nUp to ₹20k\nWhat is AYUSH Treatment?\nAYUSH stands for Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy, which were from a time when ancient wisdom (what we call Ancient Wisdom today) was the cornerstone of healthcare. These are age-old treatments with a history of 1000s of years and are rooted in Indian Culture.\nHeads Up: It takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyze a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.\nThis is why we propose a better alternative - taking a 30-minute FREE consultation with Ditto’s certified advisors. We have a spam-free guarantee, and we’ll never push you to buy a plan. Don’t delay this - we have limited slots every day, so\nbook a quick call here\nbefore they run out.\nHere’s a brief outline of what each treatment is:\nAyurveda:\nAyurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that uses herbs, diet, and yoga to maintain health and treat diseases.\nYoga:\nYoga is a set of exercises that focuses on physical, mental, and spiritual well-being through postures, breathing exercises, and natural therapies.\nUnani:\nA Greco-Arabic system of medicine that uses herbal remedies, dietary practices, and alternative therapies to treat diseases.\nSiddha:\nThis is one of the oldest systems of medicine, which uses minerals and herbs to treat various ailments that affect you.\nHomeopathy:\nA system of medicine based on the principle of \"like cures like\". It uses highly diluted substances to trigger your body’s natural healing process.\nShould you opt for AYUSH Treatment?\nWith growing awareness of the side effects of conventional medicine, AYUSH treatments offer a natural and holistic alternative. But AYUSH Treatments are not for everybody. For instance, mainstream medication and healthcare services are the only way to go if you're looking for immediate/speedy relief/recovery from an ailment.\nHere are some other pros and cons to consider while opting for AYUSH cover in your health insurance policy:\nPros of AYUSH Treatment in Health Insurance\nCons of AYUSH Treatment in Health Insurance\nNatural and Holistic: AYUSH treatments focus on natural remedies and your overall well-being, aiming for long-term health benefits without harmful side effects.\nChronic Illness Relief: These treatments are particularly beneficial for managing chronic illnesses and improving the quality of life for elderly patients.\nGovernment Support: The Indian government supports and promotes AYUSH treatments, providing legitimacy and encouraging insurers to include them in their policies.\nLong Treatment Duration: AYUSH treatments can take longer to treat ailments compared to allopathy.\nLimited Availability: Not all hospitals and medical centres offer AYUSH treatments. More often than not, coverage is limited to specified centres accredited by the AYUSH Ministry.\nNot Suitable for All Conditions: AYUSH may not be effective for acute medical emergencies or major surgeries.\nHere’s an example of when you could opt for AYUSH treatment:\nYou have been experiencing severe knee pain for months. Despite trying various conventional treatments, the pain persists. A doctor suggests that you might need knee replacement surgery if the condition worsens. Having all your hope lost, you go for Ayurveda treatments. After a few months of consistent treatment, your pain begins to subside. Several months later, the pain is almost gone, and you can walk normally again, avoiding surgery.\nHere’s when you shouldn’t:\nYou have been in a road accident and are rushed to the emergency room. The doctors there determine that you need immediate surgery to save your life. In such medical emergencies, opting for allopathic treatment would probably be better.\nWho should opt for a Health Insurance Policy that covers AYUSH Treatments?\nThere are no explicit conditions for whom to opt for AYUSH treatments. However, it can be particularly beneficial for:\nIndividuals above 60 years:\nSenior citizens often look for treatments with fewer side effects and those that improve overall well-being. AYUSH coverage is perfect for this.\nPeople with Chronic Illnesses:\nPeople managing long-term health conditions often find relief and better management through AYUSH therapies.\nThose Preferring Natural Therapies:\nIf you prefer natural and holistic approaches to health care, you may opt for AYUSH coverage in your health insurance policies.\nCTA\nWhat are the Best Health Insurance Policies that Cover AYUSH Treatments?\nHDFC ERGO Optima Secure\n:\nHDFC ERGO Optima Secure is a comprehensive health insurance plan that includes AYUSH treatments. The policy covers hospitalisation expenses for AYUSH treatments taken in a government hospital or any institute recognised by the Government, provided you are admitted there for at least 24 hours.\nDrawbacks:\nThe policy does not cover\nday-care treatments\nor\nOPD consultations\nfor AYUSH treatments.\n2.\nAditya Birla Activ One\n:\nAditya Birla Activ One is known for its comprehensive wellness benefits, including AYUSH treatments. It covers AYUSH up to the sum insured and includes annual health check-ups and an unlimited restoration benefit. Overall, this is a great policy!\nDrawbacks:\nThe insurer has yet to catch up with its overall operational efficiency benchmark. However, we are hopeful, considering the improving numbers across the compliant volume (as you can see in\nour comprehensive review\nof the insurer).\n3.\nCare\nSupreme:\nThis policy is ideal if you are on a budget and seeking comprehensive health insurance coverage. It provides high-sum insured options, no disease-wise sub-limits or room rent capping, coverage for alternative treatments under AYUSH, annual health check-ups, and a super NCB that increases the sum insured by 100% each year up to 500%. Apart from this, there are several add-ons that you can opt for, making this policy more comprehensive.\nDrawbacks:\nThis policy has a longer waiting period for pre-existing diseases. As an insurer, Care has a slightly higher compliant volume.\n4.\nNiva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n:\nNiva Bupa ReAssure 2.0 stands out for its unique features and extensive coverage, including for AYUSH treatments. It has no room rent restrictions, disease-wise sub-limits, or copayment and covers AYUSH Treatments up to the sum insured. ReAssure 2.0 also has a unique no-claim bonus, wherein the unclaimed amount from the previous year gets carried forward to the next year.\nDrawbacks:\nNiva Bupa's recent hit in credibility is a major concern. As witnessed by its recent increase in complaint volume, Niva Bupa could benefit from better operational metrics.\n5.\nBajaj Allianz\nHealth Guard Gold\n:\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold is a decent policy that strictly covers what one needs. There is no copayment or disease-wise sub-limits, but there is a room restriction for a single private room. Daycare treatments are covered, but domiciliary or home care are not.\nDrawbacks:\nThere is a sub-limit of only up to ₹20k for AYUSH Treatments.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your\nHealth\nInsurance?\nAt Ditto, we’ve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy. Why customers like Deepak below love us:\n✅No-Spam & No Salesmen\n✅\nRated 4.9/5 on Google Reviews by 5,000+ happy customers\n✅\nBacked by Zerodha\n✅\n100% Free Consultation\nYou can book a FREE consultation. Slots are running out, so make sure you\nbook a call now!\nConclusion\nAYUSH appeals to many people looking for alternatives to conventional medicine by offering a holistic approach to healthcare. With the Government also incentivising AYUSH Treatments, health insurers are now covering such treatments, albeit in a limited manner. However, this is a step in the right direction, giving people a choice. That said, health insurers cover only a limited number of healthcare facilities certified by the AYUSH Ministry.\nWhen choosing a policy, consider your current healthcare needs, the policy's limits, and the specific benefits you may need in the future. This will help you select the best policy for your needs.\nLast updated on\n9 August 2024"

    "title": "Health Insurance Add-Ons | Your 2024 Guide",
    "text": "10 February 2023\n•\nHealth Insurance\nWhat are Health Insurance Add-Ons?\nTable of Contents\nWe purchase health insurance to safeguard ourselves from financial turmoil during medical emergencies. Considering that such plans are financially responsible for the quality of your healthcare services, you require a comprehensive plan. Finding a policy that comprises all the features you need and yet hits the sweet spot of affordability takes effort.\nThis is where health insurance add-ons come into play. Such riders are meant to customise your plan while keeping it pocket-friendly (since rider charges are usually low).\nWhile the popularity of health insurance plans in the market and the rising competition among insurers have led to multiple new health insurance add-ons, you need to analyse which are value-worthy and meet your medical requirements and financial bandwidth.\nWhat are Health Insurance Add-ons?\nHealth insurance\nadd-ons\nor riders are customisable options that add to your base plan. This ensures we have protection for specific situations that your base plan may or may not cover.\nSeveral add-ons are available across different policies, but not all of them may prove to be worth it. Let’s explore these add-ons in detail now!\nHeads Up: It takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyze a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.\nThis is why we propose a better alternative - taking a 30-minute FREE consultation with Ditto’s certified advisors. We have a spam-free guarantee, and we’ll never push you to buy a plan. Don’t delay this - we have limited slots every day, so\nbook a quick call here\nbefore they run out.\nWhat are the Top Health Insurance Add-Ons?\nProtector Rider\nBrief:\nAlmost all\ntop-notch health insurers\nprovide this rider. While the product names might differ, they all provide similar benefits, including –\nProtects against inflation -\nThe sum assured by the policy increases as per the inflation every year.\nCovers\nConsumables\n— These are the products used while the policyholder is hospitalised. This includes syringes, surgical tape, bandages, etc. The base policies usually do not cover these, but this add-on does.\nNo-claim Bonus Protection\n- If your claim is below a specific limit in a policy year, your\nno-claim bonus\nwill be protected for the following year.\nDrawback:\nThis rider slightly increases premiums. However, considering the benefits this health insurance add-on fetches, this cost bump is a small price to pay.\nTop Health Insurance Plans Offering this Add-on:\nHDFC ERGO Optima Restore,\nCare Advantage\n, Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n2.\nMaternity Coverage\nBrief:\nMaternity costs are the costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth. These are a substantial financial commitment for most couples, which is also why most policies don't cover maternity benefits. If your base plan doesn't have\nmaternity cover\n, this rider will cover it.\nDrawback:\nMaternity coverage often has a long waiting period, and both spouses should purchase it. Apart from this, the premiums would be higher, and the sub-limit for maternity may only cover some of the expenses.\nHowever, depending on the policy, this rider\nmay\nresult in immediate coverage for the newborn's vaccination expenses and potential coverage for congenital disorders within the first 90 days.\nYou can consider comparing the premiums with and without the rider to make an informed decision.\nTop Health Insurance Plans Offering this Add-on:\nCare Supreme\n, Care Plus Youth Family Floater, Niva Bupa Aspire Miracle  Aditya Birla Activ Health, Aditya Birla Activ Fit, ICICI Lombard Health AdvantEdge\nNote:\nNiva Bupa Aspire Miracle\nhas a Future Ready add-on. If you purchased the policy when you were 25 years old and opted for the Future Ready feature, if you get married at 29 and add your spouse, you and your spouse don’t need to serve the waiting period because you have already done it.\n3.\nOPD Coverage\nBrief:\nOPD Consultancy\nis a rider that covers visits to clinics or hospitals for minor issues like fever or cough. With this rider, the insurance company covers the expenses up to a specified limit instead of paying out of pocket for each visit.\nDrawback:\nWe believe that the OPD Consultancy rider may not be beneficial in most situations due to numerous restrictions – you can only claim up to a specific limit every time you go to the doctor, you can go only to specified doctors by the insurance companies, etc.\nApart from this, the premiums also increase by a similar amount to the OPD coverage you’re getting—say you’re getting ₹5 thousand in OPD coverage; your premiums will probably increase by ₹4k or ₹4.5k.\nYou're better off paying out of pocket every time you go to the doctor instead of paying this amount upfront to the insurance provider.\nTop Health Insurance Plans Offering this add-on:\nCare Supreme, Care Advantage, Care Heart,\nAditya Birla Ativ Fit\n, Aditya Birla Activ Health\n4.\nInternational Coverage\nBrief:\nSeveral policies are highly comprehensive and cover almost everything one needs, but they may not have certain features, such as\ninternational cover\n. Depending on the policy, this rider covers international treatments, whether emergency or planned.\nDrawback:\nIn most cases, even if you travel abroad, travel insurance is more than enough to cover emergency hospitalisations. But if you need planned hospitalisations covered – say some treatment is only available in the US or UK hospitals – it would be covered, but not to the extent you might expect.\nMost International riders exclude developed countries such as the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom. This is because the cost of treatment there would be too high compared to the premiums paid in India.\nThis is useful if you're an entrepreneur or businessperson who travels abroad frequently. If you check these boxes and feel the premium increase is justified, feel free to opt for this rider while purchasing your policy.\nYou must also remember that planned hospitalisations may not always be covered, depending on the policy.\nTop Health Insurance Plans Offering this Add-on:\nAditya Birla Activ Health\n, Care Plus, Bajaj Allianz My Health Care,\nTATA AIG MediCare Plus\n, Niva Bupa Health Premia.\n5.\nUnlimited Restoration\nBrief:\nRestoration is an additional sum the insurer adds to your policy once a claim is made. Specific policies offer the\nrestoration perk\nonly once, while others offer it an unlimited number of times. Purchasing this add-on will do the trick if your policy does not have unlimited restoration benefits by default.\nDrawback:\nThis will increase the premium by a small percentage.\nTop Health Insurance Plans Offering this Add-on:\nOptima Secure\n, Optima Restore Aditya Birla Activ Assure Diamond policy,\nCare Advantage\nCTA\n6.\nReduction in PED Waiting Period\nBrief:\nAlmost all health insurance policies impose a\nwaiting period\non pre-existing diseases. This usually lasts 3-4 years, but this rider will reduce that waiting period.\nWe feel that this add-on is good to have if you’re suffering from a pre-existing disease. It is always better to disclose that to the insurance company and opt for this rider than hide it.\nDrawback:\nWe would prefer you choose a plan with a lower pre-existing waiting period. However, if you have a pre-existing medical condition, a senior citizen having difficulty finding a suitable policy, or have come upon a suitable plan whose only drawback is a longer waiting period, this rider makes sense.\nTop Health Insurance Plans Offering this Add-on:\nCare Supreme, Care Advantage, Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0 (Disease Management Rider),\nStar Comprehensive Insurance Policy\n7.\nCo-Payment Waiver\nBrief:\nMost plans offered to people with multiple PEDs or people of advanced age will include several restrictions, and\nco-payment\nis one of the more common ones. Opting for this rider will either reduce your copayment percentage or eliminate it completely.\nDrawback:\nThis will increase the premium by a small percentage.\nTop Health Insurance Plans Offering this Add-on:\nCare Advantage, Aditya Birla Activ Health policy, Care Supreme, Care Classic\n8.\nHospital cash\nBrief:\nYour health insurer will pay you an amount for a fixed period when you’re hospitalised, up to a specified limit mentioned in the policy documents.\nDrawback:\nWe feel that this rider will not be helpful because\nMost policies offering this will pay only for a limited number of days,\nMost policies will cover this only on a reimbursement basis, and\nThe premiums also increase because of this.\nTop Health Insurance Plans Offering this Add-on:\nOptima Secure, Optima Restore,  Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0, Aditya Birla Activ Health policy, Star Medi Classic, Bajaj Allianz Global Personal Guard, Care Advantage\n9.\nPersonal Accident Insurance\nBrief:\nIn case you encounter an accident, your health insurer will pay a lump sum in addition to the base sum insured. But remember that all health insurance policies cover accidents from day 1. There is no waiting period for this, and this same rider is available with term insurance, too.\nDrawback:\nThis rider is also available with term insurance, where the premium will likely be much lower and the payout higher.\nTop Health Insurance Plans Offering this Add-on:\nOptima Restore, Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0, Aditya Birla Activ Assure Diamond, Bajaj Allianz Global Personal Guard Insurance, Care Advantage, ICICI Lombard Health AdvantEdge\n10.\nCritical Illness\nBrief:\nEach policy has a list of certain\ncritical illnesses\n.\nIf you are diagnosed with a disease from this List, you receive a lump sum payment over and above the base sum insured.\nDrawback:\nIf you opt for this, the payout may or may not be from the base sum insured. This rider is also available with term insurance, where the premium is likely to be much lower and the payout higher.\nHaving this add-on would be helpful, but this shouldn't be a dealbreaker, and you shouldn’t choose a plan because it has this add-on.\nTop Health Insurance Plans Offering this Add-on:\nAditya Birla Activ Health (gets activated after a survival period of 15 days),\nBajaj Allianz Health Care Supreme\n,\nICICI Lombard Health AdvantEdge\n,\nNiva Bupa Health Premia\n11.\nRoom Rent Modifier\nBrief:\nSome plans have a\nroom rent limit\n. Although we usually do not recommend plans with such limits, it is unavoidable in certain situations.\nFinding a plan is cumbersome for a cancer patient in remission. While plans may be available, they may be expensive and not as comprehensive.\nIn this case, this rider will be helpful if you find an affordable plan with a room rent limit.\nDrawback:\nThis will increase the premium by a small percentage.\nTop Health Insurance Plans Offering this\nAdd-on: Care Supreme. Aditya Birla Activ Assure Diamond,\nNiva Bupa Health Recharge\nAdvantages of Availing of Health Insurance Add-ons\nCustomisation:\nIf you found the perfect policy, but it doesn’t have just one feature, you can purchase an add-on to cover that. You can make a plain vanilla policy into a comprehensive one by buying the right add-ons.\nAffordable Access:\nA policy with all the bells and whistles usually is expensive. If you don’t want to purchase that plan but may need some of its features down the line, you can consider buying a more affordable plan with these add-ons.\nDisadvantages of Availing of Health Insurance Add-Ons\nAvailable only to the primary holder:\nIn the case of a family floater policy, the rider is available only to the primary insured.\nAdditional Cost:\nAdd-ons will not increase the base sum insured but will increase the premium.\nTips to Consider When Purchasing a Health Insurance Add-On\n#Tip 1:\nAlways make sure that the increase is justified for the benefits you’re getting by comparing the premiums with and without the rider.\n#Tip 2:\nRiders also have specific exclusions. They don’t cover everything, and we should also consider these exclusions while purchasing.\n#Tip 3:\nEach add-on also comes with waiting periods. We should ensure that this is the least. A good policy/add-on should have the least waiting period.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your\nHealth\nInsurance?\nAt Ditto, we’ve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

Especially if you're a senior citizen or have pre-existing conditions and find a policy that mostly fits your needs but lacks a couple of essential features, you can consider adding a rider if the insurer has one.\nWhile selecting add-ons, you must also consider your medical requirements and financial bandwidth. They must provide genuine value to your policy, mainly because numerous options are available across the industry.\nLast updated on\n9 August 2024"

So picking out the best health insurance plans can be challenging.\nThis is why we put together this list to help you shortlist the best\nhealth insurance policies\nin India for 2025.\nBest Health Insurance Plans in India 2025\nTop Health Plans\nInsurer Rating\nFeature Rating\nAffordability\nFinal Rating\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n4.5\n4.5\n3.5\n4.2\nCare Supreme\n3.5\n4.5\n4.8\n4\nNiva Bupa Reassure 2.0\n3.2\n4.8\n4.8\n3.8\nAditya Birla Activ Fit\n3.8\n3.5\n4.6\n3.8\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\n4\n3\n4\n3.8\nHeads Up:\nIt takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyse a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.

Book today!\nOur Methodology\nIf youâre new to insurance, we highly recommend you check out our\nHealth Insurance guide for beginners\n.\nNow, we compiled this list using two broad criteria.\nThe first one is our assessment of the insurance company marketing a given policy. Any company can float a health insurance plan whose\nfeatures\nlook amazing on paper. But if customers have trouble buying the policy, making a claim, or resolving issues, then ultimately the product features donât count for much. So weâve taken into consideration several operational and financial metrics, like claim settlement numbers, track record, and solvency ratios to rank every health insurance company in India.\nWe then took each product and\ncompared\ntheir features. Now bear in mind that most insurance companies will have a basic affordable product, a comprehensive product, and a premium product. The basic product doesnât offer a lot of protection. And the premium products are too expensive and have features that often donât add a lot of value for most people. So while compiling this list weâve only considered comprehensive products that offer significant protection while not burning a hole in your pocket.\nWith that introduction out of the way, letâs look at the top health insurance plans in a little more detail.\nBest Health Insurance Plans\n1\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure Health Insurance\nHDFC Ergo\nOptima Secure takes the top rank this year. It was introduced to replace the companyâs best-selling product -\nOptima Restore\n. In just 2 years since its launch, it has done just that â exceeding expectations from all corners and emerging as our top recommendation for the best health insurance plan for the year 2024.\nInsurer Rating\n4.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n3.5\nFinal Rating\n4.2\nWhy\nOptima Secure\nis our top recommendation\nOptima Secure is an extremely comprehensive policy. It has no room rent restrictions, no\nco-pay clause\n, covers\nAyush treatments\nand has reasonable\nwaiting periods\nfor\npre-existing diseases\n. It also has a bunch of industry-first features that will excite a lot of people.\nSecure Benefit:\nSecure benefit instantly doubles your cover the moment you buy the policy. So for instance, if you buy a a policy with a sum insured of â¹10 lakhs, you get the â¹10 lakhs as base cover and an additional â¹10 lakhs as âSecureâ benefit. Effectively you get double the cover without having to pay more.\nProtect Benefit:\nUsually, insurers donât cover non-medical expenses that could include things like bandages, syringes, gloves, and masks. Even if they do cover it, they ask you to pay extra. But Optima Secure covers these expenses at no additional cost.\nPlus Benefit:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, Optima Secure has completely remodeled the bonus feature and is now offering 50% bonus cover every year irrespective of whether you made a claim. The bonus could go as high as 100% if you renew your policy for 2 consecutive years.\nOn a stand-alone basis, these features may not mean much. But when you compare it against Optima Restore, youâll see why this is a huge leap.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

So if affordability is a concern, itâs best to look at other plans on this list.\n2\nCare Supreme Health Insurance\nCare\nSupreme is second on our list as it is now the best-selling health insurance policy within Careâs stable. The company launched this plan to compete against the likes of HDFC Ergoâs Optima Secure and Niva Bupaâs Reassure. And considering the features on board and the price point at which it sells, Care Supreme can be a very attractive option for a lot of people.\nInsurer Rating\n3.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n4\nWhy\nCare Supreme\nis No.2 on our list\nItâs a comprehensive plan, that offers pretty much every\nhealth insurance add-ons\nyou need, and it is perhaps one of the most affordable plans in this category. Some of the top features include:\nUnlimited Automatic Restoration\n:\nCare Supreme will automatically refill your cover every time you make a claim. So if you have a policy with a cover of â¹10 lakhs and you make a claim totalling â¹2 lakhs, it will restore your cover back to â¹10 lakhs the moment you make the claim.\nNo Bonus clawbacks:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, they will usually clawback a part of the bonus if you ever make a claim. Care Supreme however has no such clause and you will have your bonus intact even if you make multiple claims.\nAffordability:\nThis isnât a feature as much. But itâs still worth noting that the difference in price point between Care Supreme and other similar plans is substantial. For instance, Optima Secure (our top recommendation) is nearly 30% more expensive when compared to Care Supreme for the profiles listed below.\nPremium comparison\nOptima Secure\nCare Supreme\nMale 28, living in Bangalore\nâ¹12,892\nâ¹7,701\nFamily of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹24,418\nâ¹14,357\nCouple of an advanced age -\nMale 66, Female 63\nNA\nâ¹62,210\nRead our full comparison report of\nCare Supreme vs HDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThere is a 4-year waiting period for pre-existing diseases and the only way to cut this down is to buy separate add-ons. Thereâs also another insurer-specific reason why we arenât ranking this plan higher. The claim settlement and complaint numbers for Care arenât that amazing.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE!

Also, Reassure 2.0 builds on the success of Reassure by offering 3 variants of the same plan with extremely comprehensive features at very competitive price points. For the purpose of this list, we are considering the Platinum variant of Reassure 2.0 which sits right between the\nBronze\nvariant and the\nTitanium\nvariant.\nInsurer Rating\n3.2\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.8\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Reassure 2.0 is third on our list\nIt is one of the best policies in its class. It's economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits at a very attractive price point. Hereâs a select few features that we like:\nForever\nRestoration\n:\nYour cover is restored in full the moment you make a claim. And you will have the extra cover throughout your policy term. Also, the restored sum will be added on top of your existing cover and you can claim the full amount (what's left of your base cover and the restored sum) while making a claim.\nAge lock benefit:\nYour premiums will not increase until you make a claim. However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nCarry Forward Bonus:\nEvery year the policy will calculate the unutilized base cover and transfer it to the next year. So if you started with â¹10 lakhs and you made a claim totaling â¹2 lakhs, the remaining â¹8 lakhs will be added to your cover next year and you will have â¹18 lakhs (â¹10 lakhs base cover + â¹8 Lakhs unutilized base cover + bonus) for the next year.\nReassure\nReassure 2.0\nForever Restoration\nAge Lock Benefit\nCarry Forward Bonus\nPremiums for Family of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹21,306\nâ¹19,560\nRead our full comparison report of\nNiva Bupa ReAssure vs Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThereâs nothing to complain about the features. But there are a few issues with the insurer. After the change in management (Max Bupa to Niva Bupa), we have seen a general rise in the amount of complaints. Our own experience working with the insurer on the claim settlement process has left us a bit frustrated. So we canât possibly place them any higher despite the attractive price point and the industry-first features on hand.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE! Book a call now. Limited slots available.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\n4\nAditya Birla Activ Fit Health Insurance\nAditya Birla\nmakes our list at number 4 because most people we tend to fall between the ages of 18 and 45. And this policy is designed specifically for them. It offers significant discounts if youâre healthy, it has no outrageous restrictions, a very good restoration benefit, supercharged bonus feature and it sells at a very attractive price point.\nInsurer Rating\n3.8\nProduct Feature Rating\n3.5\nAffordability\n4.6\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Aditya Birla Activ Fit takes the 4th spot\nAs we noted already itâs a comprehensive policy and it offers some very nice benefits for people who keep healthy:\nUpfront good health discount:\nYou get an upfront 10% discount on your first policy premium by simply undergoing a successful health assessment.\n100% Binge Refill:\nYour cover will be restored in full every time you make a claim. It offers unlimited restoration.\nMaternity and OPD Coverage:\nYou also get some coverage for\nmaternity-related expenses\nand\noutpatient consultations\n. And while we donât usually recommend these features (since it can burn a hole in your pocket), Aditya Bira offers all of this and more without asking you to pay a bomb.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nWhile the product features are decent and the insurer does okay on most fronts, the maximum entry age for the product is capped at 45 years. So if youâre older than 45 you canât buy this policy, which could be frustrating for those who are above the ages of 45.\n5\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\nBajaj Allianz\nHealth Guard Gold makes our list at no 5. The plan does what you would expect from a comprehensive health policy. Itâs not very expensive. And Bajaj Allianz has been posting very respectable claim settlement numbers so far. All things considered, this is a solid plan from a solid company.\nInsurer Rating\n4\nProduct Feature Rating\n3\nAffordability\n4\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\ntakes the 5th spot\nAs we noted earlier, itâs important to look at product features. But itâs even more important to evaluate the insurer. And when we compare Bajaj Allianzâs claim settlement numbers over the last 3 years against other insurers on this list, you will see why this is one of our top 5 recommendations.\nClaim Settlement Ratios\nBajaj Allianz\nAditya Birla\nCare\nHDFC Ergo\nNiva Bupa\n2020-2021\n94.5%\n89.3%\n95.2%\n97%\n90.7%\n2021-2022\n90.8%\n93.7%\n87%\n100%\n90.8%\n2022-2023\n96.8%\n95.9%\n90%\n95.5%\n90.5%\n2023-2024\n95%\n95%\n90%\n98%\n91%\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nAll the other products that make our list offer significant protection by way of extending features like unlimited restoration, supercharged bonus features and unique benefits that you may not find anywhere else. The problem with Health Guard Gold is that it does what you expect it do, but there arenât any shiny features to boast of. So that should explain why we didnât place the plan higher on the list.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, weâve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

But hey, it's still a bonus.\nLearn More\nYouâll never have to split the bill\nThe insurer will bear the entire cost of treatment (up to the sum insured). You wonât have to pay a single penny. Meaning this policy has no co-payment.\nLearn More\nYou always have full cover irrespective of the disease\nNo funny business here. If your insurer hasnât explicitly stated they wonât cover a certain illness, you can claim the full amount up to the sum insured, irrespective of the disease youâre dealing with. Meaning this policy doesn't impose the dreaded disease wise sub-limits.\nLearn More\nGood Restoration Benefit\nEven after you claim part of the cover on one occasion, you will have 100% of the cover restored, so that you can use this benefit in the event you have to endure multiple hospitalizations.\nLearn More\nFree Health Checkups every  year\nIf youâre planning on getting a full body checkup every   year just to make sure youâre in fine working condition, the insurer will cover the costs.\nLearn More\nCovers Alternative Medicine\nThink of getting Ayurvedic, Homeopathic or other alternative treatments to cure an illness? Your insurer will cover you fully, up to the sum insured.\nLearn More\nYou can pick any room you like\nShared room, single room, deluxe room or any room thatâs available. The insurer wonât nitpick on your choice of room since the policy has no restrictions on room rent.\nLearn More\nPre & Post hospitalization expenses covered\nNo worries if the doctor had to run a host of diagnostic tests before or after hospitalizing you. The insurer has your back. They will cover this amount in full for a pretty reasonable duration -\n60\ndays before you are hospitalized and\n180\ndays after discharge. This includes the cost of medication by the way.\nLearn More\nDay Care treatments covered\nIf youâre hospitalized for less than 24 hours in lieu of a minor procedure, then the insurer will cover these costs too. Think dialysis, chemotherapy or minor surgeries.\nLearn More\nFull coverage even if you are forced to hospitalize at home\nThe insurer will bear the costs even if you are hospitalized at home due to a condition or the hospital running out of beds. In insurance lingo, they call this a policy with domiciliary cover.\nLearn More\nWhat's okay here?\nReasonable waiting period for pre-existing diseases\nIf youâre already dealing with diabetes, cardiovascular problems or any such illnesses, the insurer will cover all costs arising out of these pre-existing problems after you wait for 3 years.\nLearn More\nIf youâre already dealing with diabetes, cardiovascular problems or any such illnesses, the insurer will cover all costs arising out of these pre-existing problems after you wait for 3 years.\nLearn More\nAdd-on\ns\nProtector\nWith this add-on, the insurer will increase your cover in line with inflation every year and you also get extended coverage for generally excluded items like syringes, gloves, PPE kits etc.\nIndividual Personal Accident\nThe add-on pays a portion of the cover amount to customers in the event the policy holder had to deal with deaths, injuries, and partial or total disability resulting from an accident.\nHospital Cash\nThe insurer pays a lumpsum by adding a fixed sum (daily cash) every day until the day of discharge so you can deal with any potential loss in income during this time. The money will be reimbursed to you after you submit the required documents post-discharge, and while this looks like a neat benefit to have, we donât recommend it since the benefit doesnât compensate for the extra premium you pay.\nUnlimited Restore\nUnlimited Restore will restore your cover in full every time a claim is settled.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDoes Optima Restore have waiting periods?\nYes. Optima Restore imposes 3 kinds of waiting periods -\n30-Day Waiting Period:\nHospitalizations wonât be covered for the first 30 days of the policy unless itâs an accident.\nSpecific Illness Waiting Period:\nThereâs a 2-year waiting period for a list of diseases which is a mandate before you can start claiming.\nPre-Existing Disease Waiting Period:\nThere's a 3-year waiting period for any pre-existing disease you may have while buying the policy.\nDoes Optima Restore have room rent restrictions?\nDoes Optima Restore offer a restoration benefit?\nDoes Optima Restore cover AYUSH treatments?\nDoes Optima Restore offer a bonus?\nDoes Optima Restore offer maternity benefits?\nDoes Optima Restore offer international coverage?\nDoes Optima Restore offer dental protection?\nDoes Optima Restore offer coverage for outpatient consultations?\nHow are the premiums calculated for Optima Restore?\nCan I avail myself of a discount on Optima Restore?\nDoes Optima Restore have entry and exit restrictions?\nHow do you file a claim if you have Optima Restore?\nWhat documents do I need to file a claim if I have Optima Restore?\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

    "title": "Star Assure Plan: Complete Review",
    "text": "13 February 2024\n•\nHealth Insurance\nStar Assure Health Insurance Plan: Customised Review\nTable of Contents\nWhen you seek a\nhealth insurance policy\n, one of the primary things you prioritise is that it is comprehensive. A policy that offers adequate coverage with maximum in-built perks and minimum restrictions. Star Assure Health Insurance Plan is an effort towards this combination of benefits. This policy is widely known for its diverse features, coverage for Assisted Reproduction Treatment, non-medical items, rehabilitation and pain management coverage, and more. On pen and paper, the plan is comprehensive.\nHowever, coming to the insurer in question - Star Health Insurance, despite its long-standing insurance track record and a vast net client pool, there are still some significant hurdles that it needs to overcome to become a credible provider in the industry. Some of the most common issues with the provider include - extremely high complaint volume, plans with room rent restrictions, expensive policies, sudden discontinuation of popular plans, rejection of valid claims, delisting network hospitals, and more.\nWe are here to find out if, despite all these shortcomings of the health insurance provider, the Star Assure Health Insurance Plan is still worth a shot. Let’s explore!\nQuick Verdict on Star Assure Health Insurance Plan\nStar Assure Health Insurance policy is a good plan with a few caveats involved across restrictions, clauses, and terms and conditions. The insurer’s reputation also doesn’t do much justice for policyholders looking to purchase the plan.\nHowever, suppose you are looking for a policy that concentrates on Assisted Reproductive treatment coverage, newborn treatment coverage, in-utero fetal surgery and intervention coverage. In that case, this is a unique plan that offers these features.\nOtherwise, you can shop around for other policies from credible insurers.\nHeads Up: It takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyze a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.\nThis is why we propose a better alternative - taking a 30-minute FREE consultation with Ditto’s certified advisors. We have a spam-free guarantee, and we’ll never push you to buy a plan. Don’t delay this - we have limited slots every day, so\nbook a quick call here\nbefore they run out.\nStar Assure Health Insurance Plan: Brief Overview\nStar Health Insurance\nis one of the oldest standalone health insurers in the country. The provider once held a monopoly in the industry due to its diverse portfolio of health insurance products and sizeable client pool (owing to its network of physical agents selling products in the market).\nHowever, Star's popularity took a hit as more players surfaced with the digital purchase of health insurance policies. Much of this can be attributed to Star’s latest issues across lost credibility over discontinued plans, delisting partner hospitals, rejecting claims, and withdrawing crucial disease-specific (cancer) health insurance plans. The metrics for the insurer reflect this drop in overall performance:\nClaim Settlement Ratio\n(CSR) of 82.01% (the industry average is 90.97%; the higher, the better, but not above 100%)\nIncurred Claim Ratio (ICR) of 82.17% (the industry average is  82.96%; an ideal range would be somewhere between 50-70%)\nComplaint Volume of 29.04 (the industry average is  24.029; the lower, the better)\nStar Assure from the insurer’s stable is a decent plan with a few drawbacks. The coverage is adequate, ranging from ₹5 lakhs to ₹2 crores and can be availed of as an Individual plan or on a family floater basis. For the Individual policy, anyone aged between 91 days and 75 years can opt for the plan. On the other hand, in the case of the family floater policy, the policyholder can be aged between 18 and 75 years for adults and 16 days to 17 years for dependent children. While the plan covers most grounds with the basic list of features, most come with restrictions and cappings. For example, the room rent restrictions vary based on the insured sum, but if you have opted for a cover less than ₹50 lakhs, you have to expect a room rent/type restriction.\nHowever, the plan also offers unique features like Repatriation of Mortal Remains, Compassionate Travel, In-Utero Fetal Surgery / Intervention, and coverage for expenses incurred in Rehabilitation & Pain Management.\nWhile the features discussed for the Star Assure health insurance policy are a consideration that you should make, if you are finalising a product that would serve as your financial protection tool during health scares, you need to prioritise the insurer you choose. Is Star Health credible enough to serve your purpose?\nCTA\nFeatures of Star Assure Health Insurance Plan\nFEATURES\nDETAILS\nCoverage\n₹5 lakhs to ₹2 crores\nCopayment\n10% (if your entry age is 61 years or above)\nRoom rent restrictions\nYes, if your cover amount is less than ₹50 lakhs\nAffordability of premiums\nDecent\nWaiting period\nInitial: 30 days\nPre-existing ailments: 36 months (for 1 and 2 pay) and 30 months (in case of 3 pay)\nSpecific diseases: 24 months\nDomiciliary coverage\nYes\nPre & Post Hospitalisation\n60 and 180 days\nShould You Buy a Star Assure Health Insurance Plan?\nStar as an insurer:\nStart Health was a popular provider across health insurance. However, the recent issues with its overall performance, delisting of partner hospitals, withdrawal of policies, and rejection of valid claims have affected its credibility. Moreover, some of the health insurance plans offered by this insurer are not comprehensive and yet expensive.\nGoing for Star as your health insurer is a good move if you opt for Cancer-specific plans. Otherwise, shopping for a few insurers and comparing plans with free tools would be better before purchasing a health insurance policy.\n2. In-Built Features:\nStar Assure health insurance has a basic feature structure covering most bases. The plan offers automatic restoration for an unlimited number of times, coverage for non-medical items, and wellness discounts of up to 20% during renewal - among other perks. However, the plan comes with multiple caveats, making us hesitant to recommend the plan.\nHere’s a look at some of the most important features of the Star Assure health insurance policy -\nRoom rent restrictions\n:\nMuch like any other Star health insurance plan, with Star Assure, room rent/type restrictions exist, and the cappings are based on your chosen insured sum.\nCover Amount\nRoom Rent/Type Restrictions\n₹5 lakhs\n1% of the Sum Insured per day\n₹10 lakhs - ₹25 lakhs\nAny room (except suite or above category)\n₹50 lakhs and above\nNo room rent restrictions\nThis is a major drawback considering, unless you opt for a family floater plan (even then, it’s rare), you won’t want to avail a cover of ₹50 lakhs and above. Thus, you are looking at a room rent restriction that might result in you shelling out a significant amount from your pocket.\nCoverage offered:\nThe cover for Star Assure health insurance plan ranges from ₹5 lakhs to ₹2 crores. The coverage is adequate, considering medical inflation and any sudden requirement for specialised treatments. However, the premiums may be a bit pricier than you would like. Moreover, with the room rent restriction in place, despite paying the high premium, you will still need to invest from your savings.\nCo-payment\n:\nThe plan generally doesn’t require you to split the hospital bills. However, if your entry age to the policy is 61 years or above, you must pay a 10% copayment on the bill. This is reasonable, considering a majority of the plans in the market have similar terms and conditions.\nUnique features:\nStar Assure health insurance policy might be recommended if you seek plans focusing on coverage for delivery expenses, Assisted Reproduction Treatment (for sub-fertility), and treatment of newborn babies. However, each of these comes with a disease-wise sub-limit. Apart from this, there are a few other features that stand out in this plan -\n- Repatriation of Mortal Remains:\nThe insurer will pay up to ₹15,000 towards embalming remains or coffin charges. This coverage is available only on a reimbursement basis.\n- Compassionate Travel:\nIf you (the policyholder) are stuck with a medical emergency at a location that is away from your residence, the insurer reimburses up to ₹10,000 as air travel expenses for one immediate family member to travel to the place where you have been hospitalised.\n- In-Utero Fetal Surgery and Intervention:\nFollowing a\nwaiting period\nof 2 years, the insurer will pay the charges incurred during In-Utero Fetal Surgery and Intervention.\n- Assisted Reproduction Treatment:\nIn case of any sub-fertility treatments, i.e., Assisted Reproduction Treatment, the insurer offers coverage up to a specific limit based on the chosen sum insured:\nSum Insured\nAssisted Reproduction Treatment Coverage\n₹5 lakhs\n₹1 lakh\n₹10 lakhs - ₹25 lakhs\n₹2 lakhs\n₹50 lakhs and above\n₹4 lakhs\n(There is a 2-year waiting period on this perk.)\n- Newborn baby treatment:\nIf the newborn is diagnosed with congenital disorders or accidental injuries, the insurer offers coverage for the treatment up to a limit. The waiting period for this perk is 1 year, and the sub-limit varies based on the cover amount -\nSum Insured\nNewborn Baby Treatment Coverage\n₹5 lakhs - ₹25 lakhs\n₹2 lakhs\n₹50 lakhs and above\n₹4 lakhs\nWhat’s Unique about the Star Assure Health Insurance Plan?\nThe Star Assure health insurance policy has many unique features like Assisted Reproduction Treatment (for sub-fertility), treatment of newborn babies, Repatriation of Mortal Remains, Compassionate Travel, and In-Utero Fetal Surgery and Intervention. However, the capping on these features, the long waiting period for pre-existing diseases, and the insurer's reputation prove to be hurdles in the recommendation for the plan.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, we’ve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy. Why customers like Balaji below love us:\n✅No-Spam & No Salesmen\n✅\nRated 4.9/5 on Google Reviews by 5,000+ happy customers\n✅\nBacked by Zerodha\n✅\n100% Free Consultation\nYou can book a FREE consultation.

The plan has too many sub-limits for our preference and recommendation. However, suppose you already have a strong relationship with the brand. The plan can be a decent pick in that case, provided you are looking for features like in-utero fetal surgery and newborn treatments.\nLast updated on\n26 February 2025"

    "text": "Ditto\nBuy Insurance\nOpen menu\nHealth Insurance\nLife Insurance\nClaims\nRenew your policy\nCareers\nBuy Insurance\nHealth Insurance Checklist\nThis is a list of important policy features and it should give you an idea about what to expect from a decent health insurance policy\nMust have Features\n1\nDonât split the Bill\nInsurers might nudge you to consider a co-payment clause, in which case, youâll be forced to foot a part of the bill each time you make a claim. Could be 10%. Could be 20%. Could even be 30% of the bill. So opting to co-pay might not be the best option, unless you have no choice.\n2\nRestrictions on room & room rent\nSome insurers wonât let you pick a room you like. Instead, theyâll have a limit on room rent. And in the event, you breach this limit, theyâll make you pay extra for every little service rendered in the room and not just the rent. At the end of it all, youâll end up paying a good portion of the bill. So opt for a policy that doesnât have too many restrictions on this front.\n3\nCheck for Disease Wise Sub-limits\nItâs what happens when the insurer offers you a massive cover (say 10 lakhs) for a modest fee, only to include restrictions on how much of this cover will be available for each disease. So, in effect, youâll likely end up having only a part of the 10 lakhs available in most cases.\n4\nOpt for pre and post-hospitalization care\nNobody falls sick right off the bat. Youâll likely have to go through a host of diagnostic tests before youâre hospitalized. Once youâre discharged youâll have to worry about medication. And these costs can add up. So itâs always best to pick a policy that covers pre & post-hospitalization care.\n5\nSeek a Low Waiting Period\nIf you have pre-existing diseases (including diabetes, blood pressure or thyroid-related illnesses), then itâs likely youâll have to wait a fixed period before your insurer starts covering claims arising out of these complications. Typically anywhere less than 3 years. So itâs always best to pick a policy where you donât have to wait a lot.\n6\nCoverage for daycare treatments\nChemotherapy, dialysis, a quick appendectomy. All of these procedures might last less than 24 hours. And even if youâre hospitalized to avail treatment, some insurers might not cover these claims, because they donât do âdaycare treatmentsâ.\n7\nAsk for restoration benefit\nYou buy a policy for the family. You are hospitalized. You make a claim. Your cover runs out. And then a few days later, someone else in the family falls sick. But youâve already used up the cover. The only thing that can help you is a restoration benefit i.e. if your insurer restores your cover each time you make a claim. If not every time, maybe at least once? Itâs possible. You need only ask.\nGood to have Features\n1\nBonus in case you donât make a claim\nWhat if the insurer offers you extra cover every year you go without making a claim? Wouldnât that be nice? Well, guess what? Some insurance policies do offer a lot of bonus cover. So maybe it makes sense to check if your policy extends these benefits too.\n2\nFree health checkups every year\nSome insurance policies pay for your health checkups each year. So if you are looking to make sure youâre always in tip-top shape, these health checkups might come in handy.\n3\nCover for consumables (Gloves, syringes, PPE Kits etc)\nHave you seen the gloves, syringes, masks, surgical tapes, and various surgical instruments that are used up during your hospital stay? Well, most insurers usually donât cover them, leaving you to pay approximately 5% - 10% of the entire hospital bill. However, recently, multiple policies have surfaced that offer coverage for consumables as an in-built feature or as an add-on. Pick out one such comprehensive plan and you are golden!\n4\nDomiciliary coverage\nHealth insurance plans are usually always about hospitals and medical facilities, right? But what if, due to the lack of hospital beds or certain mobility issues, an insured individual is bound to stay at home and get the treatment there? This is what domiciliary coverage in health insurance offers - a feature that has now become the staple of all the top health insurance plans! Under the 2 circumstances mentioned, your insurer will cover the medical bills, cost of renting medical equipment, practitioner fees, and more!\n5\nCover for Alternative treatments\nIf youâre into alternative medicine â Think Ayurveda, Yunani, Siddha etc, then you might want to check if your insurer covers these treatment options as well.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat are the best policies without co-payment?\nMost companies do extend plans without co-payment. However, in our opinion, the three best policies without co-payment include HDFC Ergo Optima Secure, Care Supreme, Aditya Birla Activ One.\nHow many days worth of pre and post-hospitalization expenses should a good policy cover?\n30 days before hospitalization and 90 days post-hospitalization should be the bare minimum expectation. 60 days pre-hospitalization and 180 days post-hospitalization benefits would be ideal.\nWhat essential daycare treatments should a good policy cover?\nChemotherapy, dialysis, appendectomies, radiotherapy, Stone Removals.\n1\n2\n3\nView more\nNeed trustworthy advice?\nTalk to us and weâll work together to find the policy that meets your requirements.

    "text": "Ditto\nBuy Insurance\nOpen menu\nHealth Insurance\nLife Insurance\nClaims\nRenew your policy\nCareers\nBuy Insurance\nOverview\nHealth Insurance Plans\nClaim Process\nRenewal\nReviews\nCustomer Care\nCare\nOverview\nHealth Insurance Plans\nClaim Process\nRenewal\nReviews\nCustomer Care\nHealth Insurance\nCare\nCare Health Insurance (formerly Religare Health Insurance) is an Indian health insurance company. Started in 2012, the company offers many insurance policies including critical illness, top-ups plans, senior citizen plans. It also has policies that cover pre-existing heart diseases and policies for diabetic patients without any pre-policy medical checkups.\nClaim Settlement Ratio -Â\n90\n%Â\nÂ (average of last 3 years)\nNetwork Hospitals -\n11,400+\nCare Health insurance plans\n1\nCare Ultimate\nUltimate Care from the stable of Care Health Insurance is a comprehensive plan. This new policy has a host of premium features that include the Infinity Bonus (100% loyalty bonus with no max capping), Loyalty Boost (Double SI after 7 continuous claim-free years), Premium Payback, Grace Period Cover, Tenue Multiplier, PED reduction and Instant cover add-on. Additionally, you can tap into a hefty discount on the premiums for the first 3 years, and the policy offers multi-pay options for up to 5 years. \nThe best part of the Ultimate care policy has no major caveats. So, this might be an excellent pick!\nView Policy\n3\nCare Plus Complete\nAs the name suggest, this is a complete plan. Outpatient consultations, dental treatments, hefty no claim bonus, accidental death benefit, and an inflation shield  to make sure your cover grows as medical costs rise. Very few plans offer all these benefits at once.\nView Policy\n5\nCare Heart\nIf you've had a heart complication or a surgery in the past 7 years, chances are you won't find many insurers willing to cover you. And while Care Heart isn't the most comprehensive policy, it still extends you reasonable protection. So if you're a heart patient, you should be considering this policy.\nView Policy\n7\nCare Plus Youth\nA complete plan for young people. Outpatient consultations, dental treatments, hefty no claim bonus, accidental death benefit, and an inflation shield  to make sure your cover grows as medical costs rise, all bundled in one plan\nView Policy\n9\nCare Senior\nCare Senior is a good choice if youâre 60+, with pre-existing complications or if nobody is willing to insure you. However, if you have other alternatives, this policy could be a letdown, considering they'll make you wait 4 years before they start covering pre-existing complications. Also you won't have the full cover for certain diseases.\nView Policy\n11\nCare Supreme - Senior Super\nCare SupremeâSenior Super is a variant of the insurerâs now-famous Care Supreme health insurance plan. The Senior Super variant is targeted specifically for senior citizens who have complex PEDs, including cardiac issues or diabetes. Now, coming from the stable of Care, the policy is definitely more affordable than most of the senior citizen health insurance plans available in the market. However, this plan, too, has a few pitfalls - 20% mandatory co-payment, disease-wise sub-limits, and room rent coverage only up to the most economical Single Private Room. Despite all this, the plan is still a good pick overall.\nView Policy\n13\nCare Supreme - Senior Premium\nThe Care Supreme - Senior Premium is a variant of the stableâs popular plan, Care Supreme and a tweak on its Care Supreme - Senior Super plan. The Senior Premium plan, like the Senior Super policy, offers coverage for senior citizens with complicated PEDs like heart ailments or diabetes. However, in the case of Senior Premium, there are no disease-wise sub-limits, although the policy does have a couple of caveats - 20% mandatory co-payment and room rent coverage only up to the most economical Single Private Room.\nView Policy\n15\nCare Supreme\nCare Supreme is a bargain at the price at which it's selling and while it has a pre-existing disease waiting period of 3 years, you can cut this down to a mere 30 days for select conditions including Asthma, Hypertension, Diabetes, Hyperlipidimia. Similar to most plans from Care, you have to tag along add-ons to unleash its true potential.\nView Policy\n17\nCare\nCare is a decent policy. It's got a few conditions, but nothing too outrageous. It covers most bases and throws in some nice benefits. One stand-out feature is that if you have pre-existing diseases (say diabetes), you can bring down the waitng period from 3 years to 2 years, with an add-on of course. However, there are other alrernatives to this policy.\nView Policy\n19\nCare Supreme - Super Saver\nThe Care Supreme Super Saver policy is comprehensive and affordable. The plan is a base variant of the Care Supreme policy with a mandatory 25k deductible. This makes the premiums comparatively affordable. \nThen again, the true caveat of the policy is the fact that the deductible is not an optional feature. So, you canât opt out of it even if you want to. \nOverall, the policy is an average pick, and you can actually consider Care Supreme if you donât mind the slightly high premiums (as compared toÂ SuperÂ Saver).\nView Policy\n2\nJoy Today\nIf you're considering a maternity health insurance policy and are loyal to Care, their product, Care Joy, might interest you. The \"Today\" variant offers up to â¹50k in coverage (with a â¹5 lakh cover) and has a 9-month waiting period for maternity. While the policy is appealing overall, there are some drawbacks to consider. The plan is expensive and requires a 3-year premium payment structure for the 9-month maternity waiting period. It lacks restoration benefits, domiciliary perks, and free health checkups. Additionally, there is a 3-year waiting period for pre-existing conditions (PED) and a room rent restriction to a single private room.\nView Policy\n4\nEnhance Super Top-up\nA pretty decent super top-up plan overall. And while the plan doesn't offer a disproportionately large cover (has a cap of 55 lakhs) it covers most use cases and that should be decent enough for most people.\nView Policy\n6\nCare Freedom plan\nCare Freedom could be your only choice within the Care stable if you have pre-existing complications like diabetes, blood pressure or a high Body Mass Index. But they'll make you wait 2 years before they start covering these illnesses. And you'll have to split a part of the bill when you are hospitalized. So do read more below.\nView Policy\n8\nCare Classic\nCare Classic is an okay policy. While it does offer some protection for people considering assisted reproductive procedures, it falls short in other departments. Most notably, it imposes restrictions on the kind of room you can pick. So in many ways, this is build for a very specific audience and isn't very appealing to the general public.\nView Policy\n10\nCare Advantage\nA ridiculously high cover for an almost unbelievable price. This policy sounds too good to be true. Perhaps the only chink in its armour is that if you're forced to get treatment at home due to the unavailability of hospital beds, the insurer won't cover these expenses. Despite this, the policy stands out as a solid option.\nView Policy\n12\nSenior Health Advantage\nCare Senior Health Advantage is a last resort plan for senior citizens. Sure, it comes with a poor bonus structure, with no restoration, with room rent limits and sub-limits on cataracts, knee replacement surgeries, cancer treatments, modern treatments and more, but, itâs still one of the very few plans available for senior citizens aged 60 and above with critical pre-existing conditions. On the flip side, if you are not a senior citizen or a senior citizen with benign health conditions you can consider other alternatives.\nView Policy\n14\nCare Supreme - Value for Money\nCare Supreme Value For Money fails to hit the mark. While the plan is affordable (much like its name suggests), the features are pretty restrictive and cover the basics only. \nApart from its caveat of room rent restriction (that is capped at a single private room), a mandatory copayment of 20% at non-Care Supreme-VFM network, and a low coverage amount of 10 lakhs to 15 lakhs at the most, the plan has No paid add-ons. Additionally, this policy might not be available at all locations for purchase, further limitingÂ itsÂ access.\nView Policy\n16\nSupreme Enhance Super Top-up\nIf you are looking for an affordable super top-up plan to boost your base cover by 45 lakhs to 95 lakhs, Care Supreme Enhance can be a good pick. The plan offers unlimited restoration perks and a 10% to 100% loyalty bonus, among other pros. Additionally, the plan has a mandatory add-on, under which, the room rent coverage has no restrictions. Overall,  if you are a Care loyalist, itâs a good move to buy this plan.\nView Policy\n18\nJoy Tomorrow\nIf you're considering a maternity health insurance policy and are loyal to Care, their product, Care Joy, might interest you. The âTomorrowâ variant of Care Joy offers maternity coverage of up to â¹50k, provided you have a base cover of â¹5 lakhs. While it offers coverage for the newborn from 91 days to 24 months, the policy surely isnât without its set of caveats - no restoration benefits, domiciliary perks, or free health checkups. You are covered for your room rent in full, unless you choose something more luxurious than an AC private room. This plan has a PED waiting period of 3 years and a maternity waiting period of 2 years. On the other hand, if you have your mind set on Care Joy, the âTomorrowâ variant might still be more affordable than its âTodayâ variant.\nView Policy\nCare Health insurance claim process\nCare\nclaims can be of different types based on the hospital in which you are getting the treatment. If itâs part of\nCare\n's network hospitals, you can get a âCashless claimâ in which insurance company directly pays the bills to the hospital. But if your choice of hospital is not part of their network, then you have to pay the bills and apply for reimbursement claim. Hereâs a brief process for both types of claims:\nCashless Claims\n1\nInform the Hospital Desk\nAll network hospitals have an insurance desk. You can submit your policy copy (even soft copy works), ID proof, initial diagnosis report and the insurance desk will request the insurance company for âpre-authorizationâ. In case of planned treatments, you need to do this process 2 days before hospitalization\n2\nInsurerâs decision\nBased on the provided documents, insurance company approve the claim and the hospital will start the treatment and they will co-ordinate with insurer for the treatment costs. In case of Cashless claim rejection, you can still go ahead with the treatment. In this case, you will need to pay the bills initially and can file for a reimbursement claim later\n3\nDischarge\nIf your cashless claim is approved, at the time of discharge, the insurance company will do the final settlement with the hospital and once that is sorted, you are good to go.\nReimbursement Claims\n1\nInform the insurance company\nFor any planned treatments, you need to inform the insurance company 2 days before hospitalisation. In case of emergency, you can inform within 24 hours of admission. Insurance company will acknowledge the intimation.\n2\nHospitalization\nYou need to submit a insurance claim form along with original copies of hospital bills, doctor consultation reports, and diagonstic reports.\n3\nFile the claim\nWithin 30 days post discharge, you can initiate the claim online or at any of the registered offices of the insurance company. You need to fill a claim form and attach all the reports and bills.\n4\nInsurerâs decision\nBased on the claim form and submitted documents, insurance company will settle the claims as per policy terms and conditions.\nCare Health Insurance Renewal\nFirstly, if youâve purchased the policy online, youâll always receive an intimation e-mail from the insurer around 30 days before the renewal date. The e-mail will have a renewal link that will directly take you to the page where you can make the payment and check policy details. And itâs done. Youâll receive the policy document via e-mail.\nHowever, in case you choose to do it on your own, hereâs what you need to do:\n1\nVisit the website\nVisit the Care website and then go to the Renewal section\nhere\n.\n2\nEnter details\nYouâd be asked to provide your current policy number which you can find in the policy soft copy. You may as well be asked to enter your mobile number, email ID, Date of Birth or policy expiry date.\n3\nReview and edit the policy details\nNext, youâll be able to see details of your new policy and the renewal premium you need to pay. Also, youâll be given the option to make some changes related to sum insured, existing covered members, etc.\n4\nComplete the payment and itâs done\nOnce you confirm the details, youâll be directed to the payment gateway. Once the payment is complete, youâll receive your new policy soft copy via e-mail.\nFew things to consider when renewing your Care health insurance policy\nIf you want to increase your Sum Insured, now is the time. You canât do it anytime during the year.\nIf you didnât make a claim in the past year, make sure you have been given a no-claim bonus if your policy offers it.\nIf you want to add members like your spouse or kids, you have the option to do so only at the time of renewal. So do give this a thought.\nCustomer Reviews\nView All\nFANTASTIC PRODUCT\nVery good policy and staff\nExcellent coverage\nI buyed Care Health insurance a few days ago.

Care Supreme is sold by Care and Optima Secure is sold by HDFC Ergo. So any meaningful comparison should include a comparison of the product alongside the insurers themselves.\nSecond, we know that both products are reasonably comprehensive. They do the basics quite well, but they wonât have all the bells and whistles (Think extensive coverage for international, dental, maternity and other such matters). So if you are looking for something else entirely, then both these policies may not cut it.\nAnd finally, any comparison is ultimately futile without considering the use case. Who are you buying this policy for? You, your family, your parents?\nThatâs something youâll need to answer before using this guide. So with that introduction out of the way, we can get to comparing the actual policies themselves.\nLetâs start with\nCare Supreme\n. The product comes from\nCare\nâs stable:\nCare Health Insurance (formerly Religare Health Insurance) was founded in 2012. And in that time, theyâve managed to corner a large part of the Indian Insurance market.\nWhatâs more impressive?\nCare Health Insurance has a remarkable claim settlement ratio of 90% and a network of more than 11,400+ hospitals.\nOptima Secure\nmeanwhile comes from\nHDFC Ergo\nâs stable:\nFounded in the year 2002, the company is a joint venture between Indiaâs HDFC and Germanyâs ERGO International AG. It offers policies across motor, travel, health and other sectors. And it also happens to be one of the largest insurers in the country.\nMore importantly, HDFC Ergo boasts a claim settlement ratio of 98%, with a network of 13,000+ hospitals\nAll in all, an impressive resume.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nIf you want help with selecting the best health policy tailored to your needs, book a FREE call with our experts today by clicking here.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nCompare Insurances\nInsurance Parameters\nRecommended\nNot Recommended\nCare Supreme\nOptima Secure\nNetwork hospitals\n11,400+\n13,000+\nClaim settlement ratio\n(avg. of last 3 years)\n90\n%\n98\n%\nCo-payment\nNo\nNo\nRoom rent\nAny Room\nAny Room\nDisease sub-limit\nNo\nNo\nPre existing diseases waiting\n3\nyears\n3\nyears\nPre/Post hospitalization\n60\n/\n180\ndays\n60\n/\n180\ndays\nNo claim bonus\n50\n% per year\n(up to\n100\n%)\n50\n% per year\n(up to\n100\n%)\nDomiciliary\nAyush treatments\nRestoration benefit\n100%\nrestoration\n(unlimited no. of times\nfor any illness)\n100%\nrestoration\n(once for any illness)\nHealth check-up\nOnce every year\nMaternity\nOut Patient Department\nDay care\nFeature Comparison\nCo payment\nWith a co-payment clause, the insurer will mandate that you pay a part of the bill. So if the bill adds up to Rs. 2,00,000 and the co-payment is set at 20% then you could be asked to pay Rs. 40,000 from the bill. In this case, however, Care Supreme doesnât impose a co-payment clause. And neither does Optima Secure.\nRoom rent\nIf the policy does impose room rent restrictions then the insurer may only let you stay in a room of a certain specification or impose a cap on the total room rent. If you were to breach either criterion then the insurance company may ask you to pay a portion of all the expenses you incurred while staying in the room. In this case, however, Care Supreme doesnât impose any restrictions on the kind of room you can pick. And Optima Secure also doesnât impose any restrictions on this front. You can pick any room you want.\nSub limits\nSome policies will tell you that they will cover all medical expenses up until the sum insured, but then impose caps on the total costs you can incur while dealing with a very specific list of diseases. We call these caps âDisease Wise Sub Limits.â In this case, neither Care Supreme imposes disease-wise sub-limits nor does Optima Secure\nWaiting periods for pre-existing diseases\nIf youâre suffering from a lifestyle condition or if youâve had surgery in the past, or if youâre dealing with an acute or chronic illness at the time of buying the policy, then the insurer may classify this as a pre-existing disease. And they may tell you that they will only cover these illnesses after some time. This cooling period is referred to as the Pre-existing-disease waiting period. In this case, Care Supreme imposes a 3 year waiting period on pre-existing diseases and Optima Secure will similarly tell you to wait 3 years before making a claim related to your pre-existing diseases\nPre and post Hospitalization expenses\nMost people arenât hospitalized right off the bat. Instead, theyâll have to go through a whole series of diagnostic tests before hospitalization and take medication post-discharge. These costs are outlined as pre-hospitalization expenses and post-hospitalization expenses respectively. In this case, Care Supreme covers expenses incurred 60 days before hospitalization and expenses incurred 180 days post-hospitalization. Meanwhile, Optima Secure covers expenses incurred 60 days before hospitalization and expenses incurred 180 after hospitalization, although there may be different sub-limits\nNo claim bonus\nSome policies will tell you that they will incentivize you for not making a claim in any given year. And they offer such incentives by offering extra cover on top of the existing sum insured. This extra cover is categorized as a no-claim bonus. And in this case, Care Supreme offers a no-claim bonus of 50% and Optima Secure similarly extends a 50% no-claim bonus.\nDomiciliary\nImagine you are forced to treat yourself at home because you donât find a hospital bed, or you have a chronic condition that prevents you from visiting one, then, insurers may choose to cover your treatment even if youâre hospitalized at home. And such costs are collectively categorized as domiciliary treatment costs. In this case, however, Care Supreme offers domiciliary cover. And Optima Secure also coves domiciliary expenses.\nAyush treatments\nMost policies only cover treatments administered in a registered medical facility. However, on some occasions, you may want to pursue alternative treatments including homoeopathy, Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. These treatments are collectively categorized as Ayush treatments. And in this case, Care Supreme covers Ayush procedures and Optima Secure also extends coverage for Ayush treatments.\nMaternity benefits\nIf youâre hospitalized during childbirth, then you may have to incur significant costs during delivery of your newborn, child care and other related matters during the course of the hospitalization. These costs are collectively termed maternity costs. And in this case, neither Care Supreme offers maternity cover nor does Optima Secure.\nOut Patient Department (OPD)\nDoctor visits and regular consultations arenât usually covered by health insurance policies. They are categorized as Outpatient consultations (or OPD treatments) and patients have to bear the cost on their own. In this case, however, neither Care Supreme extends coverage for outpatient consultations, nor does Optima Secure.\nFinal Conclusion\nAfter considering all the features on hand and the claim settlement ratio of HDFC Ergo, we believe that Optima Secure is a better alternative to Care Supreme for most use cases that weâve evaluated so far.\nOther\nCare Supreme\nComparisons\nCare Supreme\nvs\nHDFC Ergo Optima Super Secure\nCare Supreme\nvs\nMax Bupa Health Premia Gold\nCare Supreme\nvs\nNew India Assurance Senior Citizen Mediclaim\nOther\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\nComparisons\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\nvs\nUnited India Individual Platinum Plan\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\nvs\nCare\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\nvs\nNational Insurance National Parivar Mediclaim Plus policy\nSelect the best plan with our help!\nGet in touch to find out what plan works best for you.

It offers a wide range of insurance policies with sum insured upto 3 Cr. It also has premium policies that offer international coverage for some critical illness like cancer, CABG etc. Some of the policies offer unlimited restoration of sum insured and health checkups right from Day 1.\nClaim Settlement Ratio -Â\n91\n%Â\nÂ (average of last 3 years)\nNetwork Hospitals -\n10,000+\nNiva Bupa (Max Bupa) Health insurance plans\n1\nAspire Diamond +\nAspire Diamond+ is a feature rich variant within Niva Bupa's Aspire stable. The plan extends features like Age Lock, a new updated bonus structure, maternity benefits with a 2-year waiting and other new-age add-ons like Fast Forward, Future Protect, and Cashbag features (as described below). But that's not all, the plan is available at a reasonable price too. Unfortunately, this aggressive pricing means that Niva Bupa has the tough task of paying out ever larger claims while also managing to keep prices low. Can they do it? We don't know.\nView Policy\n3\nHealth Companion\nHealth companion is one of Niva Bupa (Max Bupa)'s most popular product. And for good reason. It covers most bases. It's economical. It doesn't have any unsavoury conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits that are particularly useful. The only downside - Niva Bupa (Max Bupa) might just have a better product now and its called ReAssure. You might want to check that out.\nView Policy\n5\nHeartBeat Platinum\nHeartbeat Platinum is a great policy. If offers comprehensive protection. Its coverage is more than adequate. It pays for regular outpatient consultations when you visit the doctor (up to a certain limit). And you can avail international treatment for certain critical illnesses like cancer. The only catch is that this policy is much more expensive than other policies in its class.\nView Policy\n7\nReAssure 2.0 Titanium+\nMuch like ReAssure, ReAssure 2.0 Titanium+ seems like it is the best policy in its class. Its economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits including forever restoration (as described below), the best bonus cover package (among all ReAssure plans) and age-lock feature (as described below once again). Unfortunately, the aggressive pricing means that Niva Bupa has the tough task of paying out ever larger claims while also managing to keep prices low. Can they do it? We don't know.\nView Policy\n9\nHealth Pulse Classic\nHealth Pulse Classic is a decent policy and it's fairly economical. While it covers most bases, it does come with a room rent restriction. This means that if you're looking for a slightly fancy room or the room covered by the policy is not available, you will have to pay a portion of the bill amount.\nView Policy\n11\nHealth Recharge Super Top-up\nA Super Top Up plan that does what you expect most super top plans to do.  It covers most bases, allows you to top up your cover by 95 lakhs and it is one of the most economical options out there.\nView Policy\n13\nReAssure\nOn the face of it, ReAssure is the best policy in its class. Its economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits including unlimited restoration. Meaning every time you're hospitalized they'll restore the cover amount in full. Unfortunately, the aggressive pricing means that Niva Bupa has the tough task of paying out ever larger claims while also managing to keep prices low. Can they do it? We don't know.\nView Policy\n15\nReAssure 2.0 Platinum+\nMuch like ReAssure, ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ seems like it is the best policy in its class. Its economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits including forever restoration (as described below), a better bonus cover package and age-lock feature (as described below once again). Unfortunately, the aggressive pricing means that Niva Bupa has the tough task of paying out ever larger claims while also managing to keep prices low. Can they do it? We don't know.\nView Policy\n17\nAspire Titanium+\nAspire Titanium+ is the most premium variant within Niva Bupa's Aspire stable. It's has some very cool features like age lock, Fast Forward, Future Protect, and Cashbag (as described below). And some of these benefits are slightly more comprehensive than Platinum+. The only problem here is that the aggressive pricing will mean that Niva Bupa has the tough task of paying out ever larger claims while also managing to keep prices low. Can they do it? We don't know.\nView Policy\n19\nSenior First Platinum\nNiva Bupa Senior First Platinum is an exclusive plan built for senior citizens (those above 60 and under 75) and and it's slightly more robust than the Gold variant. The upside is that you may qualify for this plan when you may not qualify anywhere else. The downside is that like most senior citizen plans, they come with restrictions on room rent allocation, and sub-limits on a few surgeries. There's also the fact that Niva Bupa's complaints volume has been a bit of concern for prospectiveÂ buyers.\nView Policy\n2\nGoActive\nGoActive is a decent policy with one other major selling point. It offers cover for outpatient consultations subject to certain conditions. And while you could find other policies with better features selling at a better price point, you could give it a go if you make frequent visits to a health clinic.\nView Policy\n4\nHeartBeat Gold\nHeartbeat Gold is a great policy. It offers comprehensive protection. Its coverage is more than adequate. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. The only catch is that its much more expensive than other policies in its class.\nView Policy\n6\nAspire Platinum +\nAspire Platinum+ is an extremely feature rich variant within Niva Bupa's Aspire stable. It's very similar to Diamond+ in that it has some very cool features like age lock, Fast Forward, Future Protect, and Cashbag (as described below). But the big difference is that it extends maternity benefits with a waiting period of just 9 months as opposed to 24 months in Diamond+. Also the plan is fairly affordable. Which begs the question - Will the aggressive pricing mean that Niva Bupa has the tough task of paying out ever larger claims while also managing to keep prices low. Can they do it? We don't know.\nView Policy\n8\nHealth Premia Silver\nHealth Premia Silver is a great policy. If offers comprehensive protection. Its coverage is adequate for most use cases. And if you are looking to cover maternity this can be an option. The only catch is that this policy is pretty expensive compared to other policies in its class.\nView Policy\n10\nHealth Pulse Enhanced\nHealth Pulse Enhanced is a good policy. It doesn't have too many outrageous conditions. However, it does come with a room rent restriction. This means that if you're looking for a slightly fancy room or the room covered by the policy is not available, you will have to pay a portion of the bill amount.\nView Policy\n12\nHealth Premia Platinum\nHealth Premia Platinum policy is for the Ultra rich. No, seriously. It offers a gigantic cover ranging from 1 Crore to 3 Crore. It pays for regular outpatient consultations when you visit the doctor (up to 50,000). And it does things no other policy does.  It truly is one of a kind.\nView Policy\n14\nReAssure 2.0 Bronze+\nMuch like ReAssure, ReAssure 2.0 Bronze+ seems like it is the best policy in its class. Its economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits including forever restoration (as described below). Unfortunately, the aggressive pricing means that Niva Bupa has the tough task of paying out ever larger claims while also managing to keep prices low. Can they do it? We don't know.\nView Policy\n16\nAspire Gold +\nAspire Gold+ is the most basic variant of Niva Bupa's Aspire lineup. Although it has a new-age maternity benefit, no room restrictions, and an updated bonus feature, it also has its fair share of restrictions, including a waiting period for pre-existing diseases that spans up to 3 years and a maternity benefit that also comes with waiting periods of up to 4 years. Overall, this is an okay product to pick, although you can always shop around for more comprehensive plans.\nView Policy\n18\nSenior First Gold\nNiva Bupa Senior First Gold is an exclusive plan built for senior citizens (those above 60 and under 75) and as such, this is targeted at people who may not have the option to buy a health plan due to pre-existing conditions. The upside is that you may qualify for this plan when you may not qualify anywhere else. The downside is that like most senior citizen plans, they come with restrictions on room rent allocation, sub-limits on a few diseases and lack of bonus or restoration benefits. There's also the fact that Niva Bupa's complaints volume has been a bit of concern for prospectiveÂ buyers.\nView Policy\n20\nHealth Premia Gold\nHealth Premia Gold covers most bases. If offers comprehensive protection. Its coverage is more than adequate. And if you travel internationally often, then they'll even cover you abroad. Also, you can avail international treatments for certain critical illnesses like Cancer. The only catch is that this policy is much more expensive than other policies in its class.\nView Policy\nNiva Bupa (Max Bupa) Health insurance claim process\nNiva Bupa (Max Bupa)\nclaims can be of different types based on the hospital in which you are getting the treatment. If itâs part of\nNiva Bupa (Max Bupa)\n's network hospitals, you can get a âCashless claimâ in which insurance company directly pays the bills to the hospital. But if your choice of hospital is not part of their network, then you have to pay the bills and apply for reimbursement claim. Hereâs a brief process for both types of claims:\nCashless Claims\n1\nInform the Hospital Desk\nAll network hospitals have an insurance desk. You can submit your policy copy (even soft copy works), ID proof, initial diagnosis report and the insurance desk will request the insurance company for âpre-authorizationâ. In case of planned treatments, you need to do this process 2 days before hospitalization\n2\nInsurerâs decision\nBased on the provided documents, insurance company approve the claim and the hospital will start the treatment and they will co-ordinate with insurer for the treatment costs. In case of Cashless claim rejection, you can still go ahead with the treatment. In this case, you will need to pay the bills initially and can file for a reimbursement claim later\n3\nDischarge\nIf your cashless claim is approved, at the time of discharge, the insurance company will do the final settlement with the hospital and once that is sorted, you are good to go.\nReimbursement Claims\n1\nInform the insurance company\nFor any planned treatments, you need to inform the insurance company 2 days before hospitalisation. In case of emergency, you can inform within 24 hours of admission. Insurance company will acknowledge the intimation.\n2\nHospitalization\nYou need to submit a insurance claim form along with original copies of hospital bills, doctor consultation reports, and diagonstic reports.\n3\nFile the claim\nWithin 30 days post discharge, you can initiate the claim online or at any of the registered offices of the insurance company. You need to fill a claim form and attach all the reports and bills.\n4\nInsurerâs decision\nBased on the claim form and submitted documents, insurance company will settle the claims as per policy terms and conditions.\nNiva Bupa (Max Bupa) Health Insurance Renewal\nFirstly, if youâve purchased the policy online, youâll always receive an intimation e-mail from the insurer around 30 days before the renewal date. The e-mail will have a renewal link that will directly take you to the page where you can make the payment and check policy details. And itâs done. Youâll receive the policy document via e-mail.\nHowever, in case you choose to do it on your own, hereâs what you need to do:\n1\nVisit the website\nVisit the Niva Bupa (Max Bupa) website and then go to the Renewal section\nhere\n.\n2\nEnter details\nYouâd be asked to provide your current policy number which you can find in the policy soft copy. You may as well be asked to enter your mobile number, email ID, Date of Birth or policy expiry date.\n3\nReview and edit the policy details\nNext, youâll be able to see details of your new policy and the renewal premium you need to pay. Also, youâll be given the option to make some changes related to sum insured, existing covered members, etc.\n4\nComplete the payment and itâs done\nOnce you confirm the details, youâll be directed to the payment gateway. Once the payment is complete, youâll receive your new policy soft copy via e-mail.\nFew things to consider when renewing your Niva Bupa (Max Bupa) health insurance policy\nIf you want to increase your Sum Insured, now is the time. You canât do it anytime during the year.\nIf you didnât make a claim in the past year, make sure you have been given a no-claim bonus if your policy offers it.\nIf you want to add members like your spouse or kids, you have the option to do so only at the time of renewal. So do give this a thought.\nCustomer Reviews\nView All\nVery supportive claim team\nI had taken Max Bupa Health Insurance for myself and spouse.

Don’t delay this - we have limited slots every day, so\nbook a quick call here\nbefore they run out.\nWhat is OPD Coverage in Health Insurance?\nMost health insurance policies offer coverage only if you are admitted to a hospital. These are called\nin-hospitalisation\nexpenses. Some policies also cover\ndomiciliary treatments\n, where, if you cannot get admitted to a hospital, you can have your treatment done at home.\nWhile in-hospital and at-home treatments are covered, there is a significant gap in coverage for outpatient consultation, which can add up to a substantial amount.\nThis is why some insurers have started offering\noutpatient department (OPD)\ncoverage, either built into the policy or as an add-on.\nOPD coverage in health insurance includes consultations, treatments, and procedures that do not need hospitalisation. This can include visits to the doctor for minor illnesses, diagnostic tests, and sometimes even prescription medications. OPD coverage can be a benefit if you frequently need medical consultations and treatments that don’t require you to get admitted to a hospital.\nBut like any other feature in your health insurance policy, OPD comes with its own set of pros and cons. Let’s explore some of them now.\nAdvantages & Disadvantages of OPD Coverage in Health Insurance Policies\nOutpatient consultation is one of the first things you may do when you have the symptoms of an illness. This makes it an important part, especially for people who have\npre-existing diseases\nand\nchronic illnesses\n. And for the people who don’t have any significant ailments, here are some pros and cons to consider:\nA. Pros of OPD Coverage in Your Health Insurance Policy\nNo out-of-pocket expenses during consultations:\nWith OPD coverage, you can visit doctors and receive treatments without worrying about out-of-pocket expenses. This is particularly beneficial for routine check-ups and minor treatments, ensuring you don't delay seeking medical advice due to the cost, as the insurer settles it on a\ncashless or reimbursement basis\n.\nAdditional premiums can be used as a tax deduction:\nThe extra premium paid for OPD coverage is eligible for tax deductions under\nSection 80D\nof the Income Tax Act. This gives you additional tax relief, ensuring you make the most of the deductions.\nCan claim insurance without getting hospitalised:\nOPD coverage allows you to make claims for treatments and consultations that do not require hospitalisation. This can include expenses for consultations, diagnostics, and even medications.\nConvenience:\nOPD coverage often includes access to a vast network of doctors and clinics. This ensures you can access premium medical care without worrying about the financial implications.\nB. Cons of OPD Coverage in Your Health Insurance Policy\nSub-limit:\nMost policies with OPD coverage come with a\nsub-limit\n. This means there is a cap on how much you can claim for outpatient treatments. There can also be a sub-limit on how much you can claim for each doctor consultation and how many times you can visit a doctor. Sometimes, insurers have a list of the specified doctors you can visit, and they cover consultations only with them. This can limit the extent of your coverage, especially if you need frequent medical consultations and have a history with, say, a family doctor.\nExpensive:\nAdding OPD coverage to your health insurance policy significantly increases the\npremium\n. The premium rises in proportion to the OPD sub-limit, which, more often than not, makes it more cost-effective just to pay the consultation charge out-of-pocket. OPD coverage may not be justifiable if you do not frequently visit doctors or need outpatient treatments.\nExclusions:\nOPD coverage often\nexcludes\ncertain treatments, such as dental and cosmetic procedures. Health insurance policies without OPD coverage also do not cover them unless you are involved in an accident and such procedures are medically deemed necessary.\nReimbursement claims only:\nSometimes, the process for claiming OPD expenses can be more complex and time-consuming than that for in-hospitalisation claims. This can be a deterrent for some policyholders who want to make OPD claims.\nThat said, should you opt for a health insurance policy that covers OPD?\nCTA\nShould you opt for a Health Insurance Policy with OPD Coverage?\nMost individuals do not need OPD coverage. However, there is one particular instance where OPD coverage by your health insurance policy may be beneficial – If you have any\npre-existing diseases (PEDs)\nor\nchronic ailments\n.\nIf you have any PEDs and require frequent doctor visits, medications, and minor treatments, outpatient consultation coverage could be beneficial. This also applies to people with chronic ailments such as diabetes, hypertension, etc.\nHowever, there may be cases where you wish to opt for OPD coverage. For example, outpatient consultation can significantly increase your premiums. This can be beneficial if you’re seeking a higher tax deduction under Section 80(D).\nSo, if you are looking for a health insurance plan with OPD coverage, here are some of the top health insurance policies in 2024 that offer coverage for OPD treatments.\nBest Health Insurance Policies with OPD Coverage in 2024\nCare Supreme (With Care OPD Add-On):\nCare Supreme\nis affordable and comprehensive health insurance that you can purchase until you are 99. One unique feature of this policy is that it offers coverage to anyone without age as a barrier, provided you don’t have\npre-existing conditions or benign PEDs\n, such as blood pressure, hypothyroidism, etc.\nThis policy covers OPD treatment along with the Care OPD add-on, and it does not impose copayments, room rent limits, or disease-wise sub-limits. It also offers coverage for day-care procedures, AYUSH, and domiciliary treatments.\nDrawbacks:\nHowever, the policy is not without drawbacks. It has a higher-than-average complaint ratio and a lengthy four-year waiting period for pre-existing diseases.\n2.\nAditya Birla Activ One VYTL:\nThis variant of\nAditya Birla\n's flagship policy has almost all the features you may require. Only one variant of Activ One covers OPD treatments, i.e. Activ One VYTL. However, all variants have no copayment, room rent restriction, disease-wise sub-limits and high no-claim bonuses. It covers pre-hospitalisation expenses for 90 days and post-hospitalisation expenses for 180 days, along with annual health check-ups, coverage for\nAYUSH\ntreatments, and more.\nDrawbacks:\nAditya Birla has yet to meet industry standards regarding its overall operational efficiency. However, considering the improving numbers of the compliant volume (as seen in our\ncomprehensive review of Aditya Birla\n), we are hopeful they will achieve it shortly.\n3.\nNiva Bupa Health Premia:\nAlthough\nHealth Premia\nmay not be at the top of Niva Bupa’s line-up, it does offer a good lineup of features. This policy has no co-payment, room rent restriction, or disease-wise sub-limit. Another benefit is that Health Premia has only a 2-year waiting period for pre-existing diseases.\nOne unique feature of Niva Bupa Health Premia is that it covers OPD consultations without an add-on. This cover of up to ₹50k can also be used for certain dental procedures, which we do not see in many policies. While this can be a benefit, there are drawbacks, too.\nDrawbacks:\nOne of the most significant drawbacks is that this policy's minimum cover amount is ₹ 1 crore. While this may seem like a benefit initially, it increases the premium significantly, making the policy less affordable for the masses. Apart from this, as an insurer, Niva Bupa can improve its operational metrics to be on par with its competitors.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, we’ve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

Instead of spending hours navigating through the hundreds of policies out there, why not\nbook a 30-minute call\nwith our expert IRDAI-certified advisors? We don’t spam or pressure you to buy. Just honest insurance advice.\nWhat is the restoration benefit in health insurance plans?\nSay you have 10 leaves left for the year and you take a much-needed trip, using up 5. Now, you’re left with only 5 for the rest of the year.\nWhat if your company replenished your leave balance and gave you 5 more days off? Sounds perfect, right?\nThat’s exactly what a restoration benefit in health insurance does, but for your sum insured.\nFor example, if your sum insured is ₹20 lakhs and you use ₹10 lakhs for a\nclaim\n, some insurers will restore ₹10 lakhs to your coverage. This means your total coverage for the year becomes ₹20 lakhs again, without paying anything extra.\nA few months later, you make another claim for a different illness, with expenses amounting to ₹20 lakhs. If your health insurance policy doesn’t have a restoration benefit, you’d only have ₹10 lakhs left from your original ₹20 lakh sum insured. This means you’d have to pay the remaining ₹10 lakhs out of pocket.\nOn the other hand, if you have a plan with the restoration benefit, you’d have to pay nothing out of pocket. Let’s use a table to understand this better:\nParticulars\nCoverage without Restoration Benefit\nCoverage with Restoration Benefit\nInitial sum insured\n₹20 lakhs\n₹20 lakhs\nFirst claim (₹10 lakhs)\nCoverage left: ₹10 lakhs\nCoverage left: ₹10 lakhs + ₹10 lakhs (restored) = ₹20 lakhs\nSecond claim (₹20 lakhs)\nInsurer pays ₹10 lakhs → You pay ₹10 lakhs out of pocket\nInsurer pays ₹20 lakhs → Coverage left: ₹20 lakhs - ₹20 lakhs = 0\nOut-of-pocket payment\n₹10 lakhs\n₹0\nNote: All the events have occurred in the same policy year. Additionally, this is an example of restoration up to base cover upon partial exhaustion for different illnesses. (We’ll learn about the types in the next section). Not all health insurance plans provide restoration this way. Please refer to the policy document of your plan to understand how restoration will work for you specifically.\nThis is how the restoration benefit automatically refills your sum insured if you exhaust it, giving you more coverage at no additional cost. This feature becomes especially valuable in\nfamily floater plans\n, where multiple hospitalizations can quickly drain your coverage. By restoring your sum insured every time you need it, the benefit ensures you’re always protected, no matter how many claims you make in a year.\nTypes of restoration benefit in health insurance plans\nNot all plans offer the restoration benefit in the same way. There are four different types of restoration, with some types being preferable to others. Let’s learn about them in this section:\nRestoration on partial or complete exhaustion of sum insured:\nSome insurers restore your sum insured only when it’s completely exhausted, while others do so even after a partial claim. Restoration on partial exhaustion is better than restoration on complete exhaustion as the restoration benefit kicks in after a single claim, regardless of how much base coverage you have left.\nFor example, if you have a ₹20 lakh sum insured and claim ₹10 lakhs, some policies will instantly restore the full ₹20 lakh coverage immediately by adding back the partially used amount. Others might restore it only after you’ve used up the entire ₹20 lakhs through a single claim or multiple claims.\nRestoration for the same or different illnesses:\nSome policies restore your sum insured for hospitalizations or claims related to any illness, even if it’s the same condition or related conditions. On the other hand, there are policies that only restore coverage for a different illness. The former is better as you can avail the benefit for any illness, which reduces out-of-pocket expenses of treating an ongoing medical condition that requires multiple hospitalizations.\nFor example, if you claim ₹10 lakhs for heart surgery and then need another ₹10 lakhs for follow-up procedures, some insurers won’t restore your coverage for the follow-up procedures as it is a related ailment. However, others will, allowing you to use the restored amount for multiple claims in the same year, regardless of the condition.\nRestoration unlimited times vs once per year:\nSome insurers offer unlimited restoration within a policy year, refilling your sum insured every time it’s exhausted. Others allow restoration only once per year, regardless of exhaustion. Obviously, unlimited restoration is preferable to restoration once per year. However, some insurers put a waiting/cooling off period between 2 restorations; ensure that you avoid those plans.\nIf you have a ₹20 lakh cover and make multiple claims of ₹10 lakhs, unlimited restoration ensures your coverage keeps refilling so you’re never left uncovered.\n100% Restoration or restoration up to base cover:\nIn health insurance, 100% restoration means your full sum insured is restored after a claim. For example, if your base cover is ₹20 lakhs and you claim ₹10 lakhs, the insurer adds back ₹20 lakhs — giving you a total cover of ₹30 lakhs.\nHowever, some policies only restore up to the base amount. So, if you claim ₹10 lakhs from a ₹20 lakh cover, the insurer adds back ₹10 lakhs, keeping your total coverage capped at ₹20 lakhs.\n100% restoration is always better as it provides more coverage than restoration up to base cover. However, most insurers will only allow you to use a sum up to your base cover (i.e., ₹20 lakhs) for a single claim, even though you have a total cover of ₹30 lakhs available.\nNote: The best kind of restoration is 100% unlimited restoration upon partial exhaustion for any illness.\nCTA\nBenefits of restoration in health insurance\nChoosing a health insurance plan with a restoration benefit can significantly strengthen your financial safety net. Let’s explore how this feature enhances your coverage and safeguards your finances:\nEnhanced coverage without additional premiums:\nThe restoration benefit replenishes your sum insured after it is fully or partially exhausted, providing extended coverage at no extra cost.\nSupport for multiple claims in a year:\nRestoration ensures you remain covered even after making multiple claims in a single policy year — a critical feature for chronic conditions or frequent hospitalizations. For severe or long-term illnesses that may require repeated hospital visits, restoration ensures uninterrupted coverage, preventing financial strain.\nProtection against rising healthcare costs:\nWith medical inflation driving treatment costs higher, restoration helps you avoid significant out-of-pocket expenses when your base coverage is depleted.\nIdeal for family floater policies:\nIn family floater plans, if one member exhausts the sum insured, the restored amount remains available for other family members, ensuring continued protection for the entire family.\nWhy do insurers offer the restoration benefit?\nFrom a probability standpoint, restoration benefits make sense for the insurer because the likelihood of multiple policyholders exceeding their benefit limits is very low. Only a small percentage of insured individuals use the restoration feature, and even fewer experience multiple high-cost claims for the same ailment that exceed thresholds like ₹3 to ₹5 lakhs.\nExample: Consider an insurance company with 1,000 policyholders. Suppose only 10 (1%) need the restoration benefit. Moreover, within these 10, the chance that one individual has several claims for the same ailment—each costing over ₹3 to ₹5 lakhs—is extremely low. The premiums collected from the majority (990 policyholders) effectively cover the minimal additional cost from those few rare, high-cost cases. This careful balance of risk helps keep the overall financial impact low for the insurer.\nTop 4 plans with restoration benefit in health insurance\nChoosing a health insurance plan with a restoration benefit can be a game-changer, but not all policies offer the same value. Let’s break down some of the top plans in 2025 that provide this feature, so you can pick the one that best suits your needs.\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure:\nOptima Secure has loading charges but provides extensive coverage and benefits to its policyholders. It is a robust health insurance plan offering coverage from ₹5 lakh to ₹2 crore. This policy has comprehensive coverage with no room rent limits, disease-wise sub-limits, or mandatory copayment. It also includes extensive\npre and post-hospitalization coverage\n, daycare procedures, and domiciliary treatments. With features like 100% restoration once during the policy period and a cumulative bonus of 50% per year up to 100% of the base sum insured, it provides significant financial protection. Unique benefits like the Secure Benefit, which doubles the base coverage from day one, and the Protect Benefit, which covers consumable expenses, make this plan an attractive choice. Additionally, home healthcare services are covered on a\ncashless basis\n. Notable add-ons include Unlimited Restoration and OPD coverage through Optima Well-being.\nAditya Birla Activ One Max\n: Aditya Birla Activ One Max provides coverage from ₹5 lakh to ₹6 crore and includes wellness benefits like HealthReturns, which offers premium discounts for maintaining good health. It offers comprehensive coverage with loading charges based on your risk assessment. The plan has no restrictions on room rent and includes pre and post-hospitalization coverage of 90 and 180 days, respectively. It also covers daycare procedures, AYUSH treatments, and domiciliary care.\nThe Claim Protect feature ensures inbuilt coverage for consumables, while the Super Reload feature provides unlimited restoration benefits after the first claim. The Super Credit Bonus increases the sum insured by 100% annually up to 500%. Additional optional covers include Chronic Care, which provides day-one coverage for pre-existing conditions like diabetes and hypertension, a Cancer Booster for enhanced cancer-related expenses, and Durable Equipment Cover for medical devices like wheelchairs and ventilators.\nCare Supreme:\nCare Supreme offers comprehensive coverage without additional loading charges for pre-existing conditions. It provides extensive coverage ranging from ₹5 lakh to ₹1 crore, ensuring flexibility without disease-wise sub-limits or\nroom rent capping\n. The plan includes 60 and 180 days of pre and post-hospitalization coverage, daycare procedures, AYUSH treatments, and domiciliary care. The restoration benefit is available an unlimited number of times during the policy period, and policyholders can benefit from a\ncumulative bonus\nof 50% per year up to 100% of the base sum insured. Notable add-ons include Instant Cover, which reduces waiting periods for pre-existing conditions like hypertension and diabetes to just 30 days.\nNiva Bupa ReAssure 2.0 Titanium+:\nNiva Bupa is known for its robust coverage options and industry-first features. Keeping up with this trend, this policy offers unlimited restoration, booster benefits for the unutilized cover amount, and several useful\nadd-ons\n. This plan also includes loading charges for higher-risk individuals. As an insurer, Niva Bupa has more than 10k+ hospitals under its network and a claim settlement ratio (CSR) of over 91%.\nICICI Lombard Elevate\n: Elevate is a highly customizable health insurance plan offering flexible coverage, including an option for unlimited sum insured. It provides extensive benefits like no mandatory co-payment, full coverage for pre and post-hospitalization expenses (90 days before and 180 days after), and domiciliary treatments. The plan includes unlimited restoration benefits, allowing multiple claims for the full sum insured within a year. Policyholders can enhance coverage with unique add-ons like reduced waiting periods for pre-existing diseases, OPD and maternity cover, and even surrogate and oocyte donor expense coverage up to ₹5 lakh. While the claim settlement ratio could improve, the plan’s tailored features and extensive add-on options make it a versatile choice for those seeking comprehensive protection.\nWhy Ditto?\nAt Ditto, we’ve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

And the protection you receive in return is characterized by the total cover or the\nSum Insured\n. So the first question you consider when buying a health insurance policy is this â\nA Quick Word:\nDid you know that going through insurance policy wordings means simultaneously scanning a financial, medical, and legal document?

No spam, no cold calls - just a conversation for your customised policy!\nLimited slots! Book today!\nWhat kind of cover should I need? Or in other words what is the ideal Sum Insured?\nWell, that depends on a few things. But in general, a cover of anywhere between â¹10â20 lakhs is a good option to consider. If you go under â¹10 lakhs, say â¹2â3 lakhs, then you run the risk of short-changing yourself.\nSure, â¹2â3 lakhs isnât a modest sum by any account. But it isnât a life-changing sum either. If youâre ever hospitalized for an ailment, you will likely be able to put together this kind of money without an insurer. It wonât be pleasant and it most certainly wonât be easy. But itâs something that you can hope to cobble together if you really need the cash.\nWhat will cripple you however is the bone marrow transplant that costs â¹20 lakhs. Or the recurring cancer treatment that can push you to the brink of financial ruin. And the â¹2â3 lakh figure simply wonât cut it. Also, medical costs keep rising disproportionately each year. In fact, medical inflation is routinely pegged at 10+%. So if you buy a â¹5 lakh plan today, it may only be worth â¹2.5 lakhs in a few years because inflation is making everything more expensive.\nSo starting off at â¹1â5 lakhs may not be the most prudent option. Unless you simply donât have the provision to set aside more money. In which case some cover is better than no cover.\nAlright, but if â¹1â5 lakh isnât an option, where are we drawing the line then? Should we go â¹50 lakhs? or â¹1 crore? Whatâs the top limit?\nWell in our experience, even the more expensive treatments hardly ever breach the â¹20 lakh mark. Youâd have to really struggle to find a comprehensive list of treatments that will cost you more. Also in most cases, health insurance policies offer you significantly higher protection than you may have imagined. For instance, with a comprehensive policy, you could get a base cover of say â¹10 lakhs, a no-claim bonus that could add another â¹10 lakhs in a couple of years, and a restoration benefit that would offer you an additional â¹10 lakhs worth of protection. All in all, youâd be covering for most exigencies by picking a cover anywhere between â¹10â20 lakhs without spending a fortune.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nIf youâre looking to understand your current policy or buy a new one, you can talk to an expert for FREE by clicking here.

Preferably 7000+.\nA good insurer should have an extensive track record. Anything greater than 5 years is a pretty decent number.\nA good insurer should also host an extensive product portfolio. Products that cover use cases with maternity benefits, outpatient consultations, senior citizens, heart patients, etc.\nA good insurer should also be proactive in dealing with customer queries.

Instead, itâs expected to offer you some guidance.\nChecklist of essential features in a good health insurance policy\nA good policy should have no room rent restrictions.\nIt will not impose a co-payment clause.\nIt should offer a no-claim bonus of atleast 50%.\nA good policy should extend a restoration benefit of atleast 100%.\nA good policy must have short waiting periods for pre-existing conditions.\nA good policy should offer pre and post-hospitalization care. Preferably 60 days before hospitalization and 90 days post hospitalization.\nIt should also cover daycare treatments.\nA good policy should also offer a free health checkup every year.\nAlso, we have a dedicated page for\nHealth Insurance checklist\nhere. You can read about it in some more detail.\nOnce we have a checklist for insurers and the policies themselves we can make a list that includes the best health insurance policies for 2025 .\nHowever, do note that the article so far describes how to pick a health insurance policy for generic cases. But if youâre reading this, you probably have a very specific use case. You could be looking to buy health insurance for a family. You could be a married couple looking to cover your newborn. You could be somebody looking to buy a policy at a bargain price. And in each case, there will be subtle differences in how you ought to approach health insurance.\nSo let's start with the most popular use case - Families.\nHow do you pick a health insurance policy for families?\nThe short answer is to pick a family floater plan.\nThe long answer is a bit more complicated. You see, a family floater policy is designed to cover you and your family under a single umbrella contract. You can include yourself and your dependents under the same plan and pay a single premium for combined coverage. However, most insurance providers have a rather narrow definition of what dependents actually mean. And they only let you include your spouse and kids alongside yourself when buying a family floater option. If you have parents and siblings, who you also intend to cover, you may not be able to do so under a family floater plan. But despite this restriction, it is an efficient and economical option if youâre looking to cover multiple members in your family and hereâs why\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nIf youâre looking to understand your current policy or buy a new one, you can talk to an expert for FREE by clicking here.

However, if youâre including them in a single plan, your premiums will be substantially lower\nIf you plan to insure your kids under the age of 18, you may not have many options besides including them in a family floater plan\nIt generally extends all the benefits that individual health policies extend.\nInsurers generally extend a family floater option with most policies they market\nWhat is Family Floater in Health Insurance?\nFrequently looked policies for families:\nHDFC ERGO\nOptima Secure\nOptima Secure is a great policy. There are no restrictions on the kind of room you can pick, you get a healthy loyalty benefit (50% increase in sum insured on every renewal until 100% of sum insured), and the heavily talked about Secure benefit. All things put together, you can get 3X the cover you originally paid for, once the loyalty benefit is fully accumulated. In many ways, this is a worthy successor to Optima Restore.\nLargest Hospital Network\nCARE\nCare Supreme\nCare Supreme is a bargain at the price at which it's selling and while it has a pre-existing disease waiting period of 3 years, you can cut this down to a mere 30 days for select conditions including Asthma, Hypertension, Diabetes, Hyperlipidimia. Similar to most plans from Care, you have to tag along add-ons to unleash its true potential.\nADITYA BIRLA\nActiv One Max\nActiv One Max is a variant within the Activ One policy series. This series allows customization over a base plan letting users pick and choose add-ons and Active One Max is the base plan. It includes several notable features, such as an exceptional bonus system and built-in consumable coverage. Additionally, it provides up to a 100% discount on renewal premiums, contingent upon adherence to a designated fitness regimen. If you are looking for an affordable plan with decent features, this could be a pretty good fit even without the customization.\nNIVA BUPA\nReassure 2.0 Platinum+\nMuch like ReAssure, ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ seems like it is the best policy in its class. Its economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits including forever restoration (as described below), a better bonus cover package and age-lock feature (as described below once again). Unfortunately, the aggressive pricing means that Niva Bupa has the tough task of paying out ever larger claims while also managing to keep prices low. Can they do it? We don't know.\nHow to buy health insurance if youâre a couple planning for kids?\nIf youâre a couple planning for kids, you probably have your eyes set on childbirth. Unfortunately, maternity procedures are expensive. A normal delivery in a private hospital in Bangalore will cost you upwards of â¹50,000. A C-section will probably be much more expensive â â¹75,000 or more. If youâre in a more expensive facility then it will set you back a lakh or so. However if youâre planning to buy insurance, just to cover these costs, then you should know a few things.\nFirst, insurers will increase your premiums considerably when you buy a plan with maternity benefits. A regular plan might cost you â¹9,000. But a plan with maternity will cost you â¹11,000 or more. Next, theyâll mandate something else. Theyâll tell you that you can only buy a maternity plan if you have your spouse included in it as well. At this point, you have to remember that one of you is paying for the maternity benefit even though you wonât ever be making a claim yourself. Men donât give birth to children and as such, the insurer is getting you to pay for something they know isnât applicable to both of you. And finally, theyâll tell you that you can only make a maternity claim after 3 years of holding the policy, give or take. And theyâll also place sub-limits â â¹30,000 for normal childbirth and â¹50,000 for a C-section. So itâs entirely possible that you may pay more in premiums during a policy term compared to the actual costs associated with childbirth.\nHowever, that doesnât mean there is absolutely no utility here either. For instance, if your newborn has complications that require urgent medical attention, youâd be well served to have a plan that covers maternity expenses, since most plans cover your newborn with Day 1.\nBest Health Insurance Plan For Expecting Couples (Maternity Insurance Plans)\nFrequently looked policies for couples planning a kid:\nADITYA BIRLA\nActiv Fit+\nThis plan is specially curated for young audiences who are into fitness. It has special discounts on both first-year premiums and renewal premiums based on medical evaluations or a fitness regime matrix. It also offers online consultations for mental illnesses based on medical evaluation. All in all, it is a good plan with good features, no outrageous conditions, so long as you're under 45.\nNIVA BUPA\nAspire Titanium +\nAspire Titanium+ is the most premium variant within Niva Bupa's Aspire stable. It's has some very cool features like age lock, Fast Forward, Future Protect, and Cashbag (as described below). And some of these benefits are slightly more comprehensive than Platinum+. The only problem here is that the aggressive pricing will mean that Niva Bupa has the tough task of paying out ever larger claims while also managing to keep prices low. Can they do it? We don't know.\nICICI LOMBARD\nElevate\nICICI Lombard Elevate is perhaps the most comprehensive plan on paper. Sure, it doesn't offer all the benefits in the base variant, but it offers you almost unlimited customization options (through add-ons) that you can then use to craft a plan of your liking. You can pick unlimited coverage, you can choose to cut waiting periods for pre existing diseases, you can opt for OPD and Maternity cover and you get some really unique perks like coverage for surrogate mother and Oocyte donor expenses up to â¹5 lakhs. The only caveat is that ICICI Lombard's claim settlement ratio isn't exactly stellar.\nSTAR HEALTH\nSuper Star\nThe Super Star plan from the stable of Star Health Insurance is a great pick (the only issue being its insurer). The plan offers a unique feature of âfreeze your age,â under which your plan's premiums stay the same until your 1st claim. When you file your 1st claim, the premium starts varying from the next policy year based on your age. However, the planâs perks extend beyond thisâthis policy is quite possibly one of the most heavily customisable plans in the market, with 21 add-ons, making it an interesting product to cater to your tailored requirements. Now, while the policy of Super Star doesnât have any pitfalls, one consideration is that there have been recent online customer feedback regarding Star's claims experience, suggesting there may be room for improvement in this area.\nTATA AIG\nMedicare Premier\nTata Medicare Premier is a great policy considering it covers most bases and then goes beyond the traditional feature set to offer dental cover, to offer coverage for international treatments and even pay for outpatient consultations. All of these are subject to certain conditions of course, but if you are looking for comprehensive coverage very few policies can beat this. The only caveat - It is an expensive policy.\nHow to buy a health insurance policy if youâre a salaried individual?\nIf youâre a salaried individual, you likely have a corporate health insurance policy. However, bear in mind that corporate health insurance policies come with their own caveats. For one, your employer may not be particularly inclined to extend a plan with extensive benefits. And they routinely impose restrictions on these plans. The most popular restrictions include restrictions on room rent. So if you want to upgrade your room when youâre being treated for an illness, you may have to pay extra. Then thereâs the fact that corporate health insurance plans only cover your expenses when youâre employed with the same company. If you quit, you will also have to let go of the benefits associated with the plan.\nMeaning, all things considered, it makes sense to have a separate health insurance plan that doesnât impose these restrictions. What plans should a salaried individual consider you ask?\nIndividual Health Insurance Plans for Corporate Employees\nFrequently looked policies for people with Diabetes:\nHDFC ERGO\nEnergy Silver\nIf you're diabetic or suffering from Hypertension, then Energy is for you, considering the fact that the insurer covers all complication arising out of these chronic diseases from Day 1. However, if you aren't diabetic maybe you could look at the other options since this policy is fairly expensive.\nCARE\nCare Supreme\nCare Supreme is a bargain at the price at which it's selling and while it has a pre-existing disease waiting period of 3 years, you can cut this down to a mere 30 days for select conditions including Asthma, Hypertension, Diabetes, Hyperlipidimia. Similar to most plans from Care, you have to tag along add-ons to unleash its true potential.\nADITYA BIRLA\nActiv One Max\nActiv One Max is a variant within the Activ One policy series. This series allows customization over a base plan letting users pick and choose add-ons and Active One Max is the base plan. It includes several notable features, such as an exceptional bonus system and built-in consumable coverage. Additionally, it provides up to a 100% discount on renewal premiums, contingent upon adherence to a designated fitness regimen. If you are looking for an affordable plan with decent features, this could be a pretty good fit even without the customization.\nNIVA BUPA\nReassure 2.0 Platinum+\nMuch like ReAssure, ReAssure 2.0 Platinum+ seems like it is the best policy in its class. Its economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits including forever restoration (as described below), a better bonus cover package and age-lock feature (as described below once again). Unfortunately, the aggressive pricing means that Niva Bupa has the tough task of paying out ever larger claims while also managing to keep prices low. Can they do it? We don't know.\nFrequently looked policies for parents who are about to retire:\nHDFC ERGO\nOptima Secure\nOptima Secure is a great policy. There are no restrictions on the kind of room you can pick, you get a healthy loyalty benefit (50% increase in sum insured on every renewal until 100% of sum insured), and the heavily talked about Secure benefit. All things put together, you can get 3X the cover you originally paid for, once the loyalty benefit is fully accumulated. In many ways, this is a worthy successor to Optima Restore.\nLargest Hospital Network\nCARE\nCare Supreme\nCare Supreme is a bargain at the price at which it's selling and while it has a pre-existing disease waiting period of 3 years, you can cut this down to a mere 30 days for select conditions including Asthma, Hypertension, Diabetes, Hyperlipidimia. Similar to most plans from Care, you have to tag along add-ons to unleash its true potential.\nADITYA BIRLA\nActiv One Max\nActiv One Max is a variant within the Activ One policy series.

Additionally, it provides up to a 100% discount on renewal premiums, contingent upon adherence to a designated fitness regimen. If you are looking for an affordable plan with decent features, this could be a pretty good fit even without the customization.\nNIVA BUPA\nHealth Companion\nHealth companion is one of Niva Bupa (Max Bupa)'s most popular product. And for good reason. It covers most bases. It's economical. It doesn't have any unsavoury conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits that are particularly useful. The only downside - Niva Bupa (Max Bupa) might just have a better product now and its called ReAssure. You might want to check that out.\nSTAR HEALTH\nSuper Star\nThe Super Star plan from the stable of Star Health Insurance is a great pick (the only issue being its insurer). The plan offers a unique feature of âfreeze your age,â under which your plan's premiums stay the same until your 1st claim. When you file your 1st claim, the premium starts varying from the next policy year based on your age.

Book a call now, limited slots only!\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nHow to make a claim if you have a health insurance policy?\nIn the case of emergency hospitalization, you have to intimate the insurer or make the claim as soon as you get the patient admitted. In the event that isnât possible, you must intimate the insurer within 48 hours of hospitalization.\nIn the case of planned treatment, you have to intimate the insurer 3 days before admission. But if you can do it sooner, you should probably consider doing that as insurance companies may take a while to investigate the veracity of your request.\nCheck for partnered hospitals â Each insurer will have a dedicated network of hospitals theyâll have partnered with. Once you find a partner hospital of your liking, you can try to make the claim on a cashless basis. That is to say that the hospital will directly communicate with the insurer and bill them without asking you to pay anything out of pocket\nIf you try to make a cashless claim, you will have to fill a Pre-Authorization Request Form.\nThe form will be made available to you once you intimate the insurer that you will be making a cashless claim. Youâll have to fill in your personal details and the hospital will fill out the rest. Once complete, you can ask the hospital to submit this form back to the insurer.\nUpon receipt of this form, the insurer will validate your claim and approve a sum that will be paid out on a fully cashless basis. In the event the treatment costs exceed this sum, then youâll have to pay the difference and seek reimbursement once youâre discharged.\nIf you donât find a network hospital of your liking or if the cashless claim doesnât pass, then you may have to file for reimbursement â wherein you pay the full cost of treatment and ask the insurer to reimburse you afterwards\nHow to file for reimbursement?\nOftentimes insurance companies may be tentative to settle a claim on a cashless basis but will gladly do so once youâve paid the bill in full. This process is called reimbursement.\nTo file a claim, you will need to download the claim form from the insurer's website. Some insurers will also have an online portal for submission.\nThe claim form is divided into two parts â Part A & Part B. Youâll have to fill out Part A and the hospital personnel will fill out part B. Theyâll also have to sign and seal the document.\nIn the meantime, you have to collect and collate all the investigation and medical reports associated with your prognosis.\nAnd finally, you will have to mail the original reports to the insurance company and wait for them to process your claim.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, weâve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

It must have specific breakdowns, detailed statements and also include consultation charges.\nInvoice details:\nMedical implants and other consumables must be supported by the invoice associated with the products.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is an ideal cover amount when you buy health insurance?\nThe ideal cover usually lies between a range of â¹10-20 lakhs. This usually strikes the best balance between affordability and coverage.\nCan you pay for health insurance in advance?\nYes, you can. You can pay your premiums for an entire year, for 2 years or for 3 years.\nCan you pay for health insurance on a monthly basis?\nYes, you can. However, we wouldnât recommend paying on a monthly basis because you have to use your credit card for the transaction and a single missed payment could void your policy.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nView more\nNeed trustworthy advice?\nTalk to us to understand your current policy better.

However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nYour premiums will not increase until you make a claim. However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nYouâll never have to split the bill\nThe insurer will bear the entire cost of treatment (up to the sum insured). You wonât have to pay a single penny. Meaning this policy has no co-payment.\nLearn More\nYou always have full cover irrespective of the disease\nNo funny business here. If your insurer hasnât explicitly stated they wonât cover a certain illness, you can claim the full amount up to the sum insured, irrespective of the disease youâre dealing with. Meaning this policy doesn't impose the dreaded disease wise sub-limits.\nLearn More\nUnlimited Restoration Benefit\nEven after you claim part of the cover on one occasion, you will be allowed to claim the full cover any number of times repeatedly if you are hospitalized in the future. All in the same year by the way!!!\nLearn More\nCarry forward your unutilized cover\nEvery year the policy will calculate the unutilized base cover and transfer it to the next year. So if you started with 10 lakhs and you made a claim totaling 2 lakhs, the remaining 8 lakhs will be added to your cover next year and you will have 18 lakhs (10 lakhs base cover + 8 Lakhs unutilized base cover as bonus) for the next year. This will continue until your cover totals 11x the base sum insured(carry forward unutilized cover up to 10x of base cover).\nLearn More\nFull coverage even if you are forced to hospitalize at home\nThe insurer will bear the costs even if you are hospitalized at home due to a condition or the hospital running out of beds. In insurance lingo, they call this a policy with domiciliary cover.\nLearn More\nYou can pick any room you like\nShared room, single room, deluxe room or any room thatâs available. The insurer wonât nitpick on your choice of room since the policy has no restrictions on room rent.\nLearn More\nPre & Post hospitalization expenses covered\nNo worries if the doctor had to run a host of diagnostic tests before or after hospitalizing you. The insurer has your back. They will cover this amount in full for a pretty reasonable duration -\n60\ndays before you are hospitalized and\n180\ndays after discharge. This includes the cost of medication by the way.\nLearn More\nDay Care treatments covered\nIf youâre hospitalized for less than 24 hours in lieu of a minor procedure, then the insurer will cover these costs too. Think dialysis, chemotherapy or minor surgeries.\nLearn More\nFree Health Checkups\nAvailable from day-1, 500 for every 1L sum insured. Max of 5000 rupees for an individual policy and up-to 10000 in a floater policy\nLearn More\nCovers Alternative Medicine\nThink of getting Ayurvedic, Homeopathic or other alternative treatments to cure an illness? Your insurer will cover you fully, up to the sum insured.\nLearn More\nWhat's okay here?\nReasonable waiting period for pre-existing diseases\nIf youâre already dealing with diabetes, cardiovascular problems or any such illnesses, the insurer will cover all costs arising out of these pre-existing problems after you wait for 3 years.\nLearn More\nIf youâre already dealing with diabetes, cardiovascular problems or any such illnesses, the insurer will cover all costs arising out of these pre-existing problems after you wait for 3 years.\nLearn More\nAdd-on\ns\nDisease Management\nThis add-on will cut waiting periods to 0 days for the following pre-existing conditions: Hypertension and Diabetes. And if you are currently diagnosed with any of these conditions, it makes sense to opt for this add-on.\nSafeguard +\nWith this add-on, the insurer will increase your cover in line with inflation every year, your bonus amount will not be affected if the claim is less than 1 Lakh in the entire year and you also get extended coverage for generally excluded items like syringes, gloves, PPE kits etc.\nHospital Cash\nWith this add-on, the insurer will hand out Rs. 1000/day, Rs. 2000/day or Rs. 4000/day in cash every day you stay at the hospital subject to certain limits. The cash is expected to replace your income during the course of your hospitalization.\nAggregate Deductible\nIf you ever have to make a claim, then youâll be expected to pay a sum before insurance company settles the claim. This amount is called the deductible. So if you want to buy a policy at a better price, you can opt to pay a higher deductible i.e. you can pay lower premiums by offering to pay a sum (a deductible) when a claim comes up.\nSafeguard\nWith this add-on, the insurer will increase your cover in line with inflation every year, your bonus amount will not be affected if the claim is less than â¹50,000 in the entire year and you also get extended coverage for generally excluded items like syringes, gloves, PPE kits etc.\nAcute Care\nWith this add-on, you get unlimited tele-consultations with Doctors (General Medical Practitioners, Specialists & Super Specialists) along with coverage for pharmacy and diagnostics up to a certain limit.\nPersonal Accident cover\nWith this add-on, the insurance company will payout a lumpsum of 5x your sum insured, in case the proposer of the policy passes away in an accident.

    "text": "Ditto\nBuy Insurance\nOpen menu\nHealth Insurance\nLife Insurance\nClaims\nRenew your policy\nCareers\nBuy Insurance\nOverview\nWhat's good here\nWhat's okay\nFAQ\nMedicare Premier\nTATA AIG\nOverview\nWhat's good here\nWhat's okay\nFAQ\nTATA AIG\nMedicare Premier\nTata Medicare Premier is a great policy considering it covers most bases and then goes beyond the traditonal feature set to offer dental cover, to offer coverage for international treatments and even pay for outpatient consultations. All of these are subject to certain conditions of course, but if you are looking for comprehensive coverage very few policies can beat this. The only caveat - It is an expensive policy.\nPolicy Wording\nView Policy Brochure\nWhat's good here?\nYouâll never have to split the bill\nThe insurer will bear the entire cost of treatment (up to the sum insured). You wonât have to pay a single penny. Meaning this policy has no co-payment.\nLearn More\nThe insurer will bear the entire cost of treatment (up to the sum insured). You wonât have to pay a single penny. Meaning this policy has no co-payment.\nLearn More\nYou can pick any room you like\nShared room, single room, deluxe room or any room thatâs available. The insurer wonât nitpick on your choice of room since the policy has no restrictions on room rent.\nLearn More\nShort waiting period for Pre Existing Diseases\nIf youâre already dealing with diabetes, cardiovascular problems or any such illnesses, the insurer will cover all costs arising out of these pre-existing problems after just 2 years. Itâs probably the best deal you can get to be honest.\nLearn More\nGood Restoration Benefit\nEven after you claim part of the cover on one occasion, you will have 100% of the cover restored, so that you can use this benefit in the event you have to endure multiple hospitalizations.\nLearn More\nSpecial Bonus for being healthy and not claiming insurance\nYour sum insured increases by 50% each year, so long as you make no claims during this period. But before you get too ahead of yourself, do note that theyâll stop offering you the bonus when your sum insured increases by 100%. Also, the bonus amount will reduce at same rate each time you make a claim. But hey, it's still a bonus.\nLearn More\nFull coverage even if you are forced to hospitalize at home\nThe insurer will bear the costs even if you are hospitalized at home due to a condition or the hospital running out of beds. In insurance lingo, they call this a policy with domiciliary cover.\nLearn More\nDoctor consultations covered\nIn the event, you are feeling sick and you want to visit your family physician for a general checkup, the insurer will cover the costs, up to a certain limit. In this case, itâs â¹5,000 annually.\nLearn More\nYou always have full cover irrespective of the disease\nNo funny business here. If your insurer hasnât explicitly stated they wonât cover a certain illness, you can claim the full amount up to the sum insured, irrespective of the disease youâre dealing with. Meaning this policy doesn't impose the dreaded disease wise sub-limits.\nLearn More\nPre & Post hospitalization expenses covered\nNo worries if the doctor had to run a host of diagnostic tests before or after hospitalizing you. The insurer has your back. They will cover this amount in full for a pretty reasonable duration -\n60\ndays before you are hospitalized and\n90\ndays after discharge. This includes the cost of medication by the way.\nLearn More\nDay Care treatments covered\nIf youâre hospitalized for less than 24 hours in lieu of a minor procedure, then the insurer will cover these costs too. Think dialysis, chemotherapy or minor surgeries.\nLearn More\nFree Health Checkups every  year\nIf youâre planning on getting a full body checkup every   year just to make sure youâre in fine working condition, the insurer will cover the costs.\nLearn More\nCovers Alternative Medicine\nThink of getting Ayurvedic, Homeopathic or other alternative treatments to cure an illness? Your insurer will cover you fully, up to the sum insured.\nLearn More\nWhat's okay here?\nMaternity benefits offered\nThe insurer will also cover expenses related to maternityâ Think hospitalization expenses incurred while giving birth. But theyâll only pay upto â¹50,000 and make you wait 4 years before covering this expense. Also, youâll only get the benefits if both, you and your spouse are enrolled in a single-family floater plan.\nLearn More\nThe insurer will also cover expenses related to maternityâ Think hospitalization expenses incurred while giving birth.

So picking out the best health insurance plans can be challenging.\nThis is why we put together this list to help you shortlist the best\nhealth insurance policies\nin India for 2025.\nBest Health Insurance Plans in India 2025\nTop Health Plans\nInsurer Rating\nFeature Rating\nAffordability\nFinal Rating\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n4.5\n4.5\n3.5\n4.2\nCare Supreme\n3.5\n4.5\n4.8\n4\nNiva Bupa Reassure 2.0\n3.2\n4.8\n4.8\n3.8\nAditya Birla Activ Fit\n3.8\n3.5\n4.6\n3.8\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\n4\n3\n4\n3.8\nHeads Up:\nIt takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyse a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.

Donât delay this - we have limited slots every day, so\nbook a quick call here\nbefore they run out.\nLimited slots! Book today!\nOur Methodology\nIf youâre new to insurance, we highly recommend you check out our\nHealth Insurance guide for beginners\n.\nNow, we compiled this list using two broad criteria.\nThe first one is our assessment of the insurance company marketing a given policy. Any company can float a health insurance plan whose\nfeatures\nlook amazing on paper. But if customers have trouble buying the policy, making a claim, or resolving issues, then ultimately the product features donât count for much. So weâve taken into consideration several operational and financial metrics, like claim settlement numbers, track record, and solvency ratios to rank every health insurance company in India.\nWe then took each product and\ncompared\ntheir features. Now bear in mind that most insurance companies will have a basic affordable product, a comprehensive product, and a premium product. The basic product doesnât offer a lot of protection. And the premium products are too expensive and have features that often donât add a lot of value for most people. So while compiling this list weâve only considered comprehensive products that offer significant protection while not burning a hole in your pocket.\nWith that introduction out of the way, letâs look at the top health insurance plans in a little more detail.\nBest Health Insurance Plans\n1\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure Health Insurance\nHDFC Ergo\nOptima Secure takes the top rank this year. It was introduced to replace the companyâs best-selling product -\nOptima Restore\n. In just 2 years since its launch, it has done just that â exceeding expectations from all corners and emerging as our top recommendation for the best health insurance plan for the year 2024.\nInsurer Rating\n4.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n3.5\nFinal Rating\n4.2\nWhy\nOptima Secure\nis our top recommendation\nOptima Secure is an extremely comprehensive policy. It has no room rent restrictions, no\nco-pay clause\n, covers\nAyush treatments\nand has reasonable\nwaiting periods\nfor\npre-existing diseases\n. It also has a bunch of industry-first features that will excite a lot of people.\nSecure Benefit:\nSecure benefit instantly doubles your cover the moment you buy the policy. So for instance, if you buy a a policy with a sum insured of â¹10 lakhs, you get the â¹10 lakhs as base cover and an additional â¹10 lakhs as âSecureâ benefit. Effectively you get double the cover without having to pay more.\nProtect Benefit:\nUsually, insurers donât cover non-medical expenses that could include things like bandages, syringes, gloves, and masks. Even if they do cover it, they ask you to pay extra. But Optima Secure covers these expenses at no additional cost.\nPlus Benefit:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, Optima Secure has completely remodeled the bonus feature and is now offering 50% bonus cover every year irrespective of whether you made a claim. The bonus could go as high as 100% if you renew your policy for 2 consecutive years.\nOn a stand-alone basis, these features may not mean much. But when you compare it against Optima Restore, youâll see why this is a huge leap.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

Limited slots available.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nOptima Restore\nOptima Secure\nSecure Benefit:\nInstant doubling of cover\nProtect Benefit:\nCover for non-medical expenses\nPlus Benefit:\nBonus cover of 50% every year irrespective of whether you make a claim\nAutomatic Restore:\nYour base cover restores in full every time you make a claim\nOptima Secure also comes from HDFC Ergoâs stable, an insurer whose\nclaim settlement\nnumbers and track record are pretty robust.\nRead our full comparison report of\nHDFC Ergo Optima Restore vs HDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nWhile the premiums may be reasonable for some profiles, Optima Secure is generally more expensive when compared to similar plans on the market. So if affordability is a concern, itâs best to look at other plans on this list.\n2\nCare Supreme Health Insurance\nCare\nSupreme is second on our list as it is now the best-selling health insurance policy within Careâs stable. The company launched this plan to compete against the likes of HDFC Ergoâs Optima Secure and Niva Bupaâs Reassure. And considering the features on board and the price point at which it sells, Care Supreme can be a very attractive option for a lot of people.\nInsurer Rating\n3.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n4\nWhy\nCare Supreme\nis No.2 on our list\nItâs a comprehensive plan, that offers pretty much every\nhealth insurance add-ons\nyou need, and it is perhaps one of the most affordable plans in this category. Some of the top features include:\nUnlimited Automatic Restoration\n:\nCare Supreme will automatically refill your cover every time you make a claim. So if you have a policy with a cover of â¹10 lakhs and you make a claim totalling â¹2 lakhs, it will restore your cover back to â¹10 lakhs the moment you make the claim.\nNo Bonus clawbacks:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, they will usually clawback a part of the bonus if you ever make a claim. Care Supreme however has no such clause and you will have your bonus intact even if you make multiple claims.\nAffordability:\nThis isnât a feature as much. But itâs still worth noting that the difference in price point between Care Supreme and other similar plans is substantial. For instance, Optima Secure (our top recommendation) is nearly 30% more expensive when compared to Care Supreme for the profiles listed below.\nPremium comparison\nOptima Secure\nCare Supreme\nMale 28, living in Bangalore\nâ¹12,892\nâ¹7,701\nFamily of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹24,418\nâ¹14,357\nCouple of an advanced age -\nMale 66, Female 63\nNA\nâ¹62,210\nRead our full comparison report of\nCare Supreme vs HDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThere is a 4-year waiting period for pre-existing diseases and the only way to cut this down is to buy separate add-ons. Thereâs also another insurer-specific reason why we arenât ranking this plan higher. The claim settlement and complaint numbers for Care arenât that amazing.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE!

Also, Reassure 2.0 builds on the success of Reassure by offering 3 variants of the same plan with extremely comprehensive features at very competitive price points. For the purpose of this list, we are considering the Platinum variant of Reassure 2.0 which sits right between the\nBronze\nvariant and the\nTitanium\nvariant.\nInsurer Rating\n3.2\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.8\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Reassure 2.0 is third on our list\nIt is one of the best policies in its class. It's economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits at a very attractive price point. Hereâs a select few features that we like:\nForever\nRestoration\n:\nYour cover is restored in full the moment you make a claim. And you will have the extra cover throughout your policy term. Also, the restored sum will be added on top of your existing cover and you can claim the full amount (what's left of your base cover and the restored sum) while making a claim.\nAge lock benefit:\nYour premiums will not increase until you make a claim. However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nCarry Forward Bonus:\nEvery year the policy will calculate the unutilized base cover and transfer it to the next year. So if you started with â¹10 lakhs and you made a claim totaling â¹2 lakhs, the remaining â¹8 lakhs will be added to your cover next year and you will have â¹18 lakhs (â¹10 lakhs base cover + â¹8 Lakhs unutilized base cover + bonus) for the next year.\nReassure\nReassure 2.0\nForever Restoration\nAge Lock Benefit\nCarry Forward Bonus\nPremiums for Family of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹21,306\nâ¹19,560\nRead our full comparison report of\nNiva Bupa ReAssure vs Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThereâs nothing to complain about the features. But there are a few issues with the insurer. After the change in management (Max Bupa to Niva Bupa), we have seen a general rise in the amount of complaints. Our own experience working with the insurer on the claim settlement process has left us a bit frustrated. So we canât possibly place them any higher despite the attractive price point and the industry-first features on hand.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

It offers significant discounts if youâre healthy, it has no outrageous restrictions, a very good restoration benefit, supercharged bonus feature and it sells at a very attractive price point.\nInsurer Rating\n3.8\nProduct Feature Rating\n3.5\nAffordability\n4.6\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Aditya Birla Activ Fit takes the 4th spot\nAs we noted already itâs a comprehensive policy and it offers some very nice benefits for people who keep healthy:\nUpfront good health discount:\nYou get an upfront 10% discount on your first policy premium by simply undergoing a successful health assessment.\n100% Binge Refill:\nYour cover will be restored in full every time you make a claim. It offers unlimited restoration.\nMaternity and OPD Coverage:\nYou also get some coverage for\nmaternity-related expenses\nand\noutpatient consultations\n. And while we donât usually recommend these features (since it can burn a hole in your pocket), Aditya Bira offers all of this and more without asking you to pay a bomb.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nWhile the product features are decent and the insurer does okay on most fronts, the maximum entry age for the product is capped at 45 years. So if youâre older than 45 you canât buy this policy, which could be frustrating for those who are above the ages of 45.\n5\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\nBajaj Allianz\nHealth Guard Gold makes our list at no 5. The plan does what you would expect from a comprehensive health policy. Itâs not very expensive. And Bajaj Allianz has been posting very respectable claim settlement numbers so far. All things considered, this is a solid plan from a solid company.\nInsurer Rating\n4\nProduct Feature Rating\n3\nAffordability\n4\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\ntakes the 5th spot\nAs we noted earlier, itâs important to look at product features. But itâs even more important to evaluate the insurer. And when we compare Bajaj Allianzâs claim settlement numbers over the last 3 years against other insurers on this list, you will see why this is one of our top 5 recommendations.\nClaim Settlement Ratios\nBajaj Allianz\nAditya Birla\nCare\nHDFC Ergo\nNiva Bupa\n2020-2021\n94.5%\n89.3%\n95.2%\n97%\n90.7%\n2021-2022\n90.8%\n93.7%\n87%\n100%\n90.8%\n2022-2023\n96.8%\n95.9%\n90%\n95.5%\n90.5%\n2023-2024\n95%\n95%\n90%\n98%\n91%\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nAll the other products that make our list offer significant protection by way of extending features like unlimited restoration, supercharged bonus features and unique benefits that you may not find anywhere else. The problem with Health Guard Gold is that it does what you expect it do, but there arenât any shiny features to boast of. So that should explain why we didnât place the plan higher on the list.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, weâve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

    "text": "Health Insurance Guide\nBuying insurance is hard. Reading a policy document is even harder. And even if you make an effort to painstakingly go through this thing, youâll most likely draw a blank because you wonât know what half those words mean. So in a bid to uncomplicate matters and teach you how to read a policy document, weâve created a set of simple case studies to explain what some of the most common terms and features actually mean. We will also tell you how they impact you and why you may or may not need them.\nSo letâs start with the most ubiquitous feature within the\nhealth insurance checklist\n- Co-payment.\nSay no to Co-Payment?\nYouâre about to buy health insurance. The agent pitches a policy with a cover totaling 5 Lakhs for a bargain price of just â¹7000 a year. But then he sweetens the pot even further. He promises to cut down the premium by 25% (roughly â¹1800/year) if only you agree to a 20% co-payment clause. You think thatâs amazing and you sign off on the agreement. Wow, you just saved â¹1800.\n9 months later, you suffer an accident. Youâre hospitalized and you need extensive care. Thankfully you make a full recovery and the bill adds up to â¹2 Lakh. No problem. Youâve got insurance. However, the insurer only pays â¹1,60,000. They ask you to pay the remaining â¹40,000 out of pocket since you promised to co-pay 20% of the bill.\nYou start doing the math. You saved â¹1,800 but you had to pay â¹40,000 because of the co-payment clause. It would take ~22 years worth of premium savings to make up for this fatal mistake. Not something you want in your insurance policy\nCo-payments almost never make sense unless they are mandatory or youâre buying it for someone whoâs old with pre-existing diseases. In this case, a co-payment clause can bring down premiums on your\nhealth insurance plan\ndrastically.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE! Book a call now. Limited slots available.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nCheck for restrictions on room & room rent\nImagine falling sick and finding out your insurer has a limit on room rent. You pick up the policy document begrudgingly and notice that that cap is set at 1% of your sum insured. 1% of â¹5 lakh insured is â¹5,000 each day. Thatâs not a lot. And now you are upset you canât pick the room you wanted â one that costs â¹10,000 a day.\nBut youâre fairly certain you wonât be staying here for long. Itâs only going to be for a couple of days. And even if you pick the nicer room, youâll only have to pay the extra â¹10,000 (2 days*5000). So you choose the plush room anyway. However, 2 days later, youâre discharged and the\ninsurance company\ndrops a bombshell.\nYouâll have to pay an extra â¹25,000. What?\nWell, their carefully worded policy document notes that most services rendered in your room including surgeon fee, consultant fee, other diagnostic exams, etc will not be covered fully. Instead, they'll only pay a part of it because you picked a room that's too expensive.\nHow much will they pay? Well, here's the math. The cap on room rent was fixed at â¹5,000, remember? Your actual room rent stood at â¹10,000. So they'll cover half your room rent and half the cost of all the services rendered in your room. For instance, if you have to undergo an operation and the surgeon's fee adds up to â¹50,000. They'll only pay â¹25,000. The rest is on you.\nAvoid policies with caps on room rent. Itâs that simple. If you still want to pursue this policy, make sure you pick a room thatâs well within the limit.\nCheck for Disease Wise Sub-limits\n10 lakh cover at a premium of just â¹6,000 a year. Thatâs the offer in front of you. But instead of jumping for joy, youâre suspecting something already. This guy is offering you a price that nobody else is matching. You are sceptical and you ponder for a while. But you go ahead with his recommendation anyway since he is a family friend of sorts.\nAnd then, one day, your worst fears come true. A slipped disk forces you into the operation theatre. You require extensive treatment. The final bill is hefty. â¹4,36,000 â inclusive of all costs. But despite your 10 lakh cover the insurer tells you they can only cover â¹2,00,000. You are outraged and you press for a clarification.\nEventually, they tell you your policy has disease wise sub-limits. Meaning, they have a cap on the total coverage amount specifically mandated for certain diseases.\nFor instance, cardiovascular diseases â They only pay â¹2,50,000\nFor knee replacements ââ¹2,75,000\nFor other major operations like the one you just had â â¹2,00,000\nAnd finally, you realize how the company could offer you a â¹10 Lakh cover at such a low premium. They probably never end up paying the full cover amount in most cases.\nDonât fall prey to this devious practice. Make sure you always know there are no disease wise sublimits. Because you donât know what will hit you. Itâs always prudent to pick a policy that has no such stipulations, after careful\ncomparison among the best health insurance plans\navailable in the market.\nIf you need help shortlisting a comprehensive Health policy for your family, talk to our IRDAI-certified experts for free.\nTalk to an advisor\nSeek Low Waiting Periods\nThe scariest thing about insurance is the uncertainty involved in buying a policyâ-âbecause the moment the sweet-talking concludes, the insurer will want to talk to you about your medical history. Do you have diabetes? Do you have any cardiovascular problems? Do you have thyroid-related illnesses? Or do you have any other pre-existing conditions? The list is endless.\nOnce they are through with that line of questioning, they might ask you to take a few medical tests. And based off of these reports, they will tell you that they will cover your hospitalization expense so long as it's not related to your pre-existing condition. But what happens if you are hospitalized for a complication arising out of a past condition? Well, in that case, they will ask you to wait for a whileâ-âmaybe 2 to 4 years. And while it makes sense for the insurer to add this clause, it can be a particularly gruelling exercise for you.\nSee the problem here is straightforward. Let's say you have problems with your blood pressure. You disclose this condition and then you buy your policy. Unfortunately, the very next year, you have a heart attack and you are desperately hoping your insurer will come through. However, it's quite possible that the insurer can deny your claim if they can connect your blood pressure disorder to the heart attack. So if an insurer makes you wait 4 years, you just have to hope and pray that you don't fall sick because of a pre-existing disease. And trust us, it's not a good place to be at.\nWaiting periods are a common feature in most insurance policies. The only thing you can do is make sure you pick a policy that makes you wait the least amount of time.\nOpt for pre and post-hospitalization care\nYou wake up one day and you start feeling dizzy. You consult your doctor. She prescribes a blood test. Nothing out of the ordinary, she says. So you go home with an ORS pack. But your condition deteriorates. You feel dizzy once again next evening. And this time the doctor prescribes an MRI. She checks the results and asks you to admit yourself to the hospital.\nThe doctor effectively treats your condition over the course of the next 3 days and you are discharged soon after.\nThe Hospital Bill adds up to â¹10,000\nThe MRI and the diagnostic tests before hospitalization adds up to â¹15,000\nYou are hoping your insurance covers both bills. But the company states they donât cover pre-hospitalization expenses. Meaning they wonât cover all the costs you had to bear leading up to your hospitalization. Which is ironical because doctors often prescribe a host of diagnostic tests before they admit you to a hospital and sometimes even after they discharge you. And it can get quite expensive.\nItâs always a good idea to pick a policy that covers both pre and post-hospitalization expenses. Say 30â60 days before and after you are treated in a hospital.\nAsk for restoration benefit\nItâs a Sunday morning and youâre sipping coffee on the hospital bed. You are thinking about how a small heart complication forced you into a 3-week stay at the hospital. More importantly, youâre thinking about how you racked up a bill totaling â¹4,88,000. Thankfully, your insurance policy is going to take care of the burden. After all, you have a â¹5 Lakh cover. So you donât have to pay anything right now. But you start thinking about other possibilities.\nSee, you bought a combined policy â For both your wife and yourself. And if she were to fall sick anytime soon, then the insurance wonât cover her bills. Youâve used up the benefits already.\nBut what if the insurance restored itself to the initial state immediately after you make a claim? What if your insurer offered you a â¹5 lakh cover once again in the event you or your wife have to be hospitalized anytime soon?\nWellâ¦Guess what? Itâs possible with a restoration benefit.\nWhile some policies offer unlimited restoration for any illness, others have some restrictions. For instance, some policies will tell you that you canât claim the restoration benefit if you have the same illness once again. In this case â a heart complication.\nItâs always prudent to opt for restoration benefits if you have a combined policy. It also makes sense even if itâs an individual policy. Just make sure you read the fine print on how the cover is restored each time and youâll be set.\nSeek coverage for treatments that last <24 hrs\nYou are out playing a game of cards with your friends. Suddenly you feel a sharp twitch in your abdomen. It's odd, but these things keep happening to you all the time. So you don't pay a lot of attention. A few moments pass. and then suddenly the twitch is there again. This time it doesn't go away. Instead, within a moment the pain intensifies. Soon, it becomes unbearable. Your friends take you to the hospital. And after a quick inspection, the doctor breaks the news. It's appendicitis and they have to operate on you immediately.\nBut it's not that big of a deal. In fact, the doctor assures you that he'll discharge you the same day. And although you require some treatment, you walk out of the hospital within 24 hours. However, it's an expensive procedure. The bill adds up to â¹80,000 and you're gobsmacked. You call your insurer hoping they will cover these costs in full. And suddenly they break the news to you.\nThey won't cover this\n.\nYou are incensed and you press for a clarification. The agent calms you down and walks you through the policy document once againâ-âwhere they explicitly note how they don't cover daycare treatments. Or in other words, treatments that require hospitalization but those that last less than 24 hours. Thinkâ-âChemotherapy, Dialysis or in this case appendicitis.\nAlways prefer policies that cover daycare treatments. Because you never know when your appendix might put you in a soup.\nIf you need help shortlisting a comprehensive Health policy for your family, talk to our IRDAI-certified experts for free.\nTalk to an advisor\nDomiciliary Expense\nA deadly pandemic starts wreaking havoc. However, your job forces you to step out every day. And then suddenly, one day you wake up with a bad cold. You are coughing incessantly. You hope itâll go away on its own. But then you have trouble breathing. Your condition deteriorates and you are forced to call the emergency services. But they tell you they canât find a hospital bed. Your only choice is to obtain treatment at home. Some hospitals provide this facility. But it's going to cost you money. A lot of money!!!\nAnd then a ray of hope. Your insurer tells you they will cover your expenses since you are forced to be treated at home.\nIt could be because of a specific condition or because the hospital couldnât find you a bed â Like in this case. Itâs rare to be in such a spot. But you are glad you have this facility nonetheless.\nAnother good-to-have benefit. But in most cases, you donât have to go out of your way to find a policy that will cover domiciliary expenses.\nBonus in case you donât make a claim\nInsurers will tell you they want you to stay fit and healthy. In fact, they will even incentivize you in a bid to achieve this objective. For instance, how would you feel if somebody told you theyâll up your cover (above and beyond the sum insured) by 50% each year in the event you donât claim insurance. That would be amazing, right?\nThink about it. You could start with a cover of â¹5 lakhs. And then see it move up to â¹7.5 lakhs and then the next year, another 50% over and the above the sum insured would take your total cover to 10 lakhs. Obviously, theyâll stop at some point. Most insurance companies will tell you theyâll stop once the cover doubles in value. In fact, theyâll also tell you theyâll cut the sum insured by the same amount (50%) in the event you claim insurance after receiving the bonus. So technically, next year, you could be back with a cover of just 5 lakhs.\nBut still, itâs a pretty nifty bonus.\nNo Claim Bonus is pretty useful. All you have to do is make sure that the bonus is actually substantial. For instance, anything below 10% is not really meaningful. So it might just be a marketing tactic.\nFree health checkups every year\nIt's a lazy Saturday afternoon. You've been waiting for almost an hour now and you can't help but look at the receptionist intently hoping he will call your name. And then suddenly when you least expect it, you hear your name called out loud. You walk into the doctor's room. She directs you to a certain spot and measures your height. She then checks your weight. She makes you sit straight and then takes your blood pressure. She listens to your heart and lungs and orders a blood test for cholesterol and blood sugar. And just before you leave, she offers some advice on how you can lower risks for diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. You get your reports the next day and everything is perfect. You don't need follow-up care. At least, not until next year.\nWhat you just had was a full body health checkup. And while some people might just ignore it altogether, it gives you a certain peace of mind. Now usually these health checkups can cost you anywhere between â¹1,000 and â¹1,500. And if you're fairly regular with these checkups, it's going to weigh on your pockets consistently.\nOnce again, we know it's not a lot of money. But it wouldn't hurt if you save on these costs entirely. And that's why some insurers will pay for your health checkups. Okay, maybe they won't do it every year. But even if they do it once in 2 years it's still an added bonus, right?\nWhile itâs not a deal-breaker, it is definitely nice to have a policy that offers you a free health checkup every year.\nCover for Alternative treatments\nYouâre pushing 50 and you feel drained each day. You go to your physician and he tells you thereâs nothing wrong. âIt could be stressâ, he exclaims. You are unsatisfied but you go home nonetheless. The next day however you bump into your neighbour. You start chatting and he suggests visiting a government certified Ayush Centre.\nSo you visit the facility and meet with the practitioners. They suggest getting an Ayurvedic Rejuvenation Therapy â Panchakarma. Itâs going to last 7â11 days and itâs going to cost you â¹25,000. Thatâs quite expensive you think. And then suddenly it hits, your health insurance policy covers Ayush treatments. So you sign off on the payment and get started immediately. Good thing, you remembered that little detail eh?\nAyush Coverage is a good-to-have feature. But remember, the policy will only cover these treatments so long as youâre hospitalized in a government certified Ayush facility.\nIf you need help shortlisting a comprehensive Health policy for your family, talk to our IRDAI-certified experts for free.\nTalk to an advisor\nMaternity Benefits\nYou are thinking of having kids. But you know you'll have to plan for it in advance. The first order of business is to make arrangements for childbirthâ-âwhen you will have to visit the hospital and get the baby delivered. You know getting there won't be a problem, but the hospitalization could turn out to be an expensive affair. But what if you could offset this by opting for an insurance policy that covers this cost? It looks like a solid idea. But alasâ¦ This plan has some issues.\nFor starters, the insurer knows for certain that they'll have to bear this expense in the event you decide to have kids. And since most people have at least one kid, the insurer will most likely have to pay up. So, many companies simply don't offer the benefit. The ones that do will make sure they are adequately compensated.\nSo they'll push the premiums way higher. Or they'll tell you they'll only cover a small part of the expense. Or sometimes, they'll only offer it in a\nfamily plan\nand make sure both you and your spouse are coveredâ-âin which case one of you is opting for the benefit even if you won't be hospitalized for a maternity-related matter.\nThere is no free lunch in this world. And while it's all good if your insurer does cover this expense, make sure you don't end up paying ridiculously high premiums just to avail this benefit. It might not be worth it.\nWhen should you opt for OPD?\nEverybody visits the doctor at least once a year. But the doctor you visit â Her consultation fee is off the roof. A routine inspection could set you back thousands. So you come up with a genius plan. You decide to buy insurance and opt for a policy that reimburses all expenses incurred during these visits. You look for options that include outpatient consultation benefits and you find one after a couple of minutes of search.\nYou exclaim â âGenius.â And you give yourself a pat on the back.\nBut alas... Nothing in this godforsaken world is as it seems.\nFor starters, the insurer knows for certain that theyâll have to pay you something each year. Just ask yourself. Have you been to the doctor this year? Have you paid over â¹1,000 in consultation fee? Have you paid more? Do you think this trend is likely to change?\nYeah... Itâs not going to change. So itâs quite likely that the insurer will be forced to reimburse you some amount each year. And thatâs why many companies simply donât offer this benefit. The ones that do will make sure they are adequately compensated. So theyâll push the premiums way higher. Or theyâll tell you theyâll only cover a small part of the expense.\nThere is no free lunch in this world. And while OPD benefits look good on paper, it's possible that youâll actually end up paying more in premiums. Believe it or not, it might actually be more cost-effective to not opt for this benefit, in most cases.\nDon't forget to share this Guide on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nTwitter"

    "title": "What is Waiting Period in Health Insurance? (Updated Top Plans - 2024)",
    "text": "21 February 2023\n•\nHealth Insurance\nWhat are Waiting Periods in Health Insurance Policies?\nTable of Contents\nA few days ago, we had an interesting interaction with one of our customers, Shashank. He booked a call with an advisor after his uncle's health insurance claim was denied because the hospitalisation was related to a\npre-existing disease\n. And the waiting period was not over yet. It turns out that, unfortunately, the waiting periods were not mentioned to his uncle while purchasing the health insurance policy.\nThis experience left him worried about purchasing good health insurance with adequate coverage for him and his family. He wanted an honest understanding of how waiting periods work in health insurance policies, and our advisors were ready to help.\nIn this article, we provide you with the same insights about waiting periods in health insurance, their importance, and how they can impact your claims process.\nAlso, if you need personalised, spam-free insurance advice, you can always\nconsult Ditto Insurance\n’s IRDAI-certified insurance experts at a convenient time.\nBest Health Insurance Policies with Low Waiting Periods\nBest Health Insurance Policies\nPre-Existing Diseases Waiting Period\nSpecific Diseases Waiting Period\nOther Features\nHDFC ERGO Optima Secure\n3 years\n2 years\nNetwork Hospitals: 13k+\nCSR: 98%\nICR: 85%\nCare Supreme\n4 years (can be reduced with add-ons)\n2 years\nNetwork Hospitals: 8.3k+\nCSR: 90%\nICR: 58%\nHeads Up: It takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyze a term life policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.\nThis is why we propose a better alternative - taking a 30-minute FREE consultation with Ditto’s certified advisors. We have a spam-free guarantee, and we’ll never push you to buy a plan. Don’t delay this - we have limited slots every day, so\nbook a quick call here\nbefore they run out.\nWhat are Waiting Periods in Health Insurance Policies?\nA waiting period in health insurance policies is the initial timeframe during which you cannot claim insurance for certain treatments. This begins from the date your policy starts and usually varies depending on the insurer and the type of waiting period the insurer imposes.\nIt is a buffer set by insurers to prevent immediate high-risk claims. This ensures that policyholders do not buy insurance just to claim benefits for pre-existing conditions or scheduled treatments right away. This safeguards not only the insurer but also the entire insurance pool so that people who\nneed\nhealth insurance will get it when they need it the most.\nLet’s understand this with an example:\nLet’s say you buy a health insurance policy today. It has a 3-year waiting period for pre-existing diseases and a 2-year waiting period for specific illnesses.\nUnfortunately, you have a road accident just 2 weeks later and need hospitalisation. Your policy will cover these expenses because accidents are unexpected. You don’t\nplan\nfor one, which is why there is no waiting period for accidents.\nHowever, let’s say you need treatment for a medical condition. The same disease can have different waiting periods depending on when it was diagnosed.\nTake cataracts, for instance. If you were diagnosed with it before purchasing the policy, you would have to wait 3 years under the pre-existing disease waiting period before making any claims related to cataracts. However, if it were diagnosed after purchasing the policy, it would be considered a specific illness and be subject to the 2-year specific illness waiting period.\nHowever, keep in mind that these are not the only two types. There are 5 types of waiting periods. Let’s explore them in detail now.\nWhat are the Different Types of Waiting Periods in Health Insurance Policies?\nHere are the different types of waiting periods in health insurance policies:\nInitial Waiting Period:\nThe initial waiting period is usually 30 days from the start date of your policy. During this time, you cannot file any claims except for accidental hospitalisations. This waiting period is standard in most health insurance policies to mitigate the risk of covering illnesses that may already be developing when you buy the policy.\n2.\nPre-Existing Diseases (PED) Waiting Period:\nPre-existing diseases\nare medical conditions you already have before purchasing the health insurance policy. The waiting period for PEDs usually ranges from 1 to 4 years, depending on the insurer, the policy, and the add-on you pick. This means that any claims related to these conditions will not be covered until the waiting period ends. Some policies allow you to reduce this waiting period with add-ons for an additional premium.\n3.\nSpecific Diseases Waiting Period:\nSome health insurance policies have a separate waiting period for certain\nspecific ailments\n, such as hernia, diabetes, or joint replacement. This waiting period generally lasts 1 to 2 years, depending on the insurer and the policy. Sometimes, the insurer may also impose a\nloading charge\nbased on the severity of the condition.\n4.\nMaternity Waiting Period:\nIf you are planning to use your health insurance for maternity-related expenses, you need to be aware of the\nmaternity\nwaiting period. This usually ranges from 9 months to 4 years or more, depending on the policy. During this time, any claims for\nmaternity expense\ns will not be covered. This waiting period ensures that people do not buy the insurance just to cover imminent childbirth expenses. It is also important to keep in mind that most insurance policies do not cover maternity expenses, and even if they do, the premiums skyrocket compared to health insurance plans without maternity coverage. Feel free to go through this article for more information on\nmaternity coverage\n.\nCTA\n5.\nCritical Illness Waiting Period:\nSome health insurance policies also have a separate waiting period for\ncritical illnesses\nlike cancer, heart attack, and stroke. This period usually ranges from 90 days to 2 years. During this time, any claims related to these critical illnesses will not be covered. This waiting period allows insurers to manage the high risk associated with critical illness claims.\nBest Health Insurance Policies\nPre-Existing Diseases Waiting Period\nSpecific Diseases Waiting Period\nOther Features\nHDFC ERGO Optima Secure\n3 years\n2 years\nNetwork Hospitals: 13k+\nCSR: 98%\nICR: 85%\nCare Supreme\n4 years (can be reduced with add-ons)\n2 years\nNetwork Hospitals: 8.3k+\nCSR: 90%\nICR: 58%\nNiva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n3-4 years (variant specific)\n2 years\nNetwork Hospitals: 8.6k+\nCSR: 91%\nICR: 57%\nAditya Birla Activ One Max\n3 years\n2 years\nNetwork Hospitals: 11k+\nCSR: 93%\nICR: 61%\nHow Do Health Insurance Providers Decide On the Waiting Period for a Policyholder?\nEven though waiting periods are more or less standard in health insurance policies, insurers consider a few factors when determining your waiting period.\nThe number one factor is probably your\nmedical history\n. This includes any chronic illnesses or frequent medical issues which play a significant role. If you have\npre-existing conditions\nlike diabetes or hypertension, insurers might impose longer waiting periods.\nAge\nis another crucial factor. Naturally, as people age, the likelihood of health complications increases. This leads insurers to extend waiting periods to manage their risk.\nInsurers may also impose a\nloading charge\non top of the base premium. A loading charge is an additional cost that we pay to the insurer to mitigate the higher risk. This charge is usually applied if you have an undesirable BMI, health condition(s), or lifestyle habits such as smoking or excessive alcohol consumption. The insurer considers all these conditions and adds an amount to the base premium.\n3 Things To Know About Waiting Periods in Health Insurance Policies\nAccidents are covered from day 1\n: All health insurance policies cover accidents from the first day of the policy, with no waiting period imposed.\nWaiting periods can be reduced with add-ons in some policies\n: Certain health insurance policies offer\nadd-ons\nthat allow you to reduce the waiting period for pre-existing conditions or specific diseases. For instance, Care offers an add-on that reduces your pre-existing disease waiting period from 4 years to just 30 days!\nRead the fine print\n: You need to thoroughly go through the policy documents to understand the specific terms and conditions related to waiting periods and avoid unpleasant surprises when making a claim. However, we understand that this can be a daunting task. You can feel free to use our\nUnderstand Your Policy\ntool to get a simplified, in-depth understanding of popular health insurance plans in India.\nWhat are the Best Health Insurance Policies with Low Waiting Periods?\nSeveral health insurance plans offer low waiting periods, making them attractive options for immediate coverage needs. Here are some of the top choices:\nHDFC ERGO Optima Secure\nHDFC ERGO\nOptima Secure plan offers comprehensive coverage with a 30-day initial waiting period, a 3-year waiting period for pre-existing conditions, and a 2-year waiting period for specific diseases. It boasts a vast network of over 13,000 hospitals, allowing you to pick any room you want. It covers pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses for 60 and 180 days, respectively. The policy also includes a unique 2X coverage from day 1 and covers AYUSH treatments, consumables, and offers a good no-claim bonus of 50% per annum up to 100%, whether you make a claim or not.\nDrawbacks:\nHDFC ERGO charges a significantly higher premium for a health insurance policy similar to that of its peers in the market.\n2. Care Supreme\nCare\nSupreme is designed for flexibility and affordability. It offers a 4-year waiting period for pre-existing conditions, which can be reduced with add-ons. It also has a 2-year waiting period for specific diseases, making it a flexible and affordable option. This policy can be purchased by individuals up to 99 years old, covers benign pre-existing diseases, and includes day-care procedures, AYUSH treatments, domiciliary treatments, and air ambulance cover up to ₹5 lakhs per year. It also offers an excellent no-claim bonus of 100% per annum, up to 500% of the sum insured, and a wellness discount of up to 30% of the premium for regular exercise.\nDrawbacks:\nCare Insurance has a higher-than-average complaint ratio than its peers. It also does not include some basic features in the base policy, and we need to purchase it as an add-on.\n3. Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\nWith a 30-day initial waiting period and a 3-year pre-existing disease waiting period in the Titanium+ variant,\nNiva Bupa\nReAssure 2.0 is a solid choice. It includes a 2-year waiting period for specific diseases and covers various medical expenses. The policy has no co-payment, disease-wise sub-limits, or room rent restrictions and includes daycare, AYUSH, and domiciliary treatments.\nReAssure 2.0 is a plan that stands out with its unique features. It features several add-ons, such as Booster Plus (no-claim bonus), ReAssure Forever (Restoration), and Lock the Clock. Lock the Clock is a stand-out feature where your premiums will only increase based on age once you make a claim. If you’re purely looking for a health insurance policy with solid features, ReAssure 2.0 by Niva Bupa is for you. However, this is not without drawbacks.\nDrawbacks:\nNiva Bupa has a\nlower CSR\nthan its competitors and a significantly higher complaint volume.\n4. Aditya Birla Activ One Max\nAditya Birla\nActiv One Max offers a 3-year waiting period for pre-existing conditions and a 2-year waiting period for specific diseases. The waiting period can also be reduced by purchasing an add-on. Aditya Birla offers an extensive network of over 11,000 hospitals and robust coverage options, extending base coverage of up to ₹ 6 crore! Activ One also offers add-ons that can reduce your premium, to wit, the per-claim deductible add-on and the room rent restriction add-on. The base policy does not have these restrictions. However, if you want to restrict yourself to a single private room or a shared dorm, you are welcome to do so. The base policy also does not have a per-claim deductible – you can add this to reduce your premium.\nDrawbacks:\nAditya Birla imposes a 10% co-payment at non-network hospitals (non-PPN hospitals). Apart from this, we feel that the company's\noperational metrics\ncan be improved, and we are hopeful they can achieve this in the near future.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, we’ve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

    "text": "9 May 2023\n•\nHealth Insurance\nWhat are the Best Health Insurance Plans for Pre-Existing Diseases in India?\nTable of Contents\nA few days ago, a client approached an advisor at Ditto. He was 28 years old and was looking for a health insurance policy. However, the issue was - he had hypertension. His concern was whether he would be able to get a policy at all.\nHere’s what our advisor told him- “We can definitely offer you one of the best health insurance plans for pre-existing diseases. However, there will be some restrictions and limitations that you should be aware of.”\nNow, while a\ncall with one of our insurance advisors\nwill offer you a solution, you might as well read through this article too. This piece will disclose all about the best health insurance policies for pre-existing diseases, things you need to remember while purchasing such plans and more.\nBest Health Insurance Plans for Pre-Existing Diseases in 2024\nPolicy\nPEDs Covered*\nLoading Charge\nWaiting Period\nPremium**\nCare Supreme\nCholesterol, BP, Asthma, Hypothyroid, Renal Calculus, Diabetes, Ligament tears, Arthritis, Hypertension, Diabetes, Hysterectomy, BPH, etc\nNo\n30 days - 4 years\n₹11.5k - ₹13.6k\nHDFC ERGO Energy\nType-1 and Type-2 Diabetes, Hypertension\nDepends on the severity.\nNone\n₹14,136\nNiva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\nCholesterol, BP, Asthma, Hypothyroid, Renal Calculus, Ligament tears, Arthritis, Hypertension, Diabetes, Hysterectomy, BPH, etc\nDepends on the severity.\n3 - 4 years\n₹10.3k -\n₹11.4k\nAditya Birla Activ Health\nAsthma, Cholesterol, Hypothyroid, Ligament Tear, Arthritis, Hypertension, Hysterectomy, BPH, etc\nDepends on the severity.\n3 years\n₹11,212\n*This is a general list, but coverage depends on a case-to-case basis.\n**Assumption: 30-year Old Male | Zone 1 | 1 Benign PED\nHeads Up: It takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyze a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.\nThis is why we propose a better alternative - taking a 30-minute FREE consultation with Ditto’s certified advisors. We have a spam-free guarantee, and we’ll never push you to buy a plan. Don’t delay this - we have limited slots every day, so\nbook a quick call here\nbefore they run out.\nWhat are Pre-Existing Diseases in Health Insurance?\nPre-existing diseases (PEDs)\nare medical illnesses you have before applying for a health insurance policy. These conditions can include chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease, as well as other specific conditions such as renal calculi (kidney stones), arthritis, or hypothyroidism.\nInsurers are particularly cautious about PEDs because if you have these conditions, you are at a higher risk of hospitalisation, which, naturally, leads to higher claims. This is why\nhealth insurance companies scrutinise these risks more carefully\nbefore issuing the policy. Depending on the insurer's evaluation, they may impose waiting periods, increase premiums, or even permanently exclude coverage for certain conditions.\nLet’s understand this better with an example:\nLet’s say you have been diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension three years before applying for health insurance. According to current IRDAI Norms, these conditions are classified as pre-existing diseases.\nUpon applying for a health insurance policy, the insurer will assess these conditions and might impose a\nwaiting period\n. During this time, any medical expenses related to diabetes or hypertension, such as medication, doctor visits, or hospitalisation, will not be covered. The insurer may also add a\nloading charge\nto the premium due to the increased risk of claims associated with these conditions.\nIn some cases, if the diabetes is particularly severe, the insurer may\npermanently decide to exclude\ndiabetes-related treatments from the policy coverage. This means you will have to bear all costs of this ailment out of pocket even after the waiting period.\nHowever, accurately disclosing all existing conditions and consulting an honest health insurance advisor before purchasing a policy can avoid complications when making a claim.\nWhat are the Best Health Insurance Plans for Pre-Existing Diseases in 2024?\nNumerous policies offer coverage, and choosing the best health insurance policy can be laborious. Here, we have simplified the process for you by shortlisting some top picks for the top health insurance policies that cover pre-existing diseases in 2024:\nCare Supreme:\nCare Supreme\nis designed for extensive coverage, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. It covers a broad spectrum of PEDs, including cholesterol, BP, and asthma. Depending on the condition and add-on you pick, the waiting period varies from 30 days to 4 years.\nDrawbacks:\nWhile Care Supreme is an affordable health insurance policy, Care, as an insurer, can have slightly better operational metrics.\nHDFC ERGO Energy:\nHDFC ERGO\nEnergy specifically covers people with diabetes (both Type-1 and Type-2) and hypertension. This policy's significant advantage is the absence of a waiting period for these conditions, making it an attractive option for those needing immediate coverage. However, it comes with significantly higher premiums compared to other policies.\nDrawbacks:\nWhile\nHDFC ERGO Energy covers Diabetes and Hypertension from day 1, it is quite an expensive health insurance policy. Apart from this, you cannot port to Energy, as the facility is unavailable. However, you can port to another policy from Energy.\nNiva Bupa ReAssure 2.0:\nNiva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\noffers a balanced approach with comprehensive coverage for various PEDs, including cholesterol, BP, asthma, hypothyroidism, renal calculus, gall bladder stones, ligament tears, arthritis, hypertension, diabetes, hysterectomy, and BPH. The waiting period for these conditions ranges from 2 to 4 years, making it a competitive option in terms of coverage and affordability.\nCTA\nDrawbacks:\nWhile Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0 is loaded with features and offers a high coverage amount, its operational metrics could be higher.\nAditya Birla Activ Health Enhanced:\nActiv Health from Aditya Birla covers multiple pre-existing conditions after the waiting period, such as asthma, cholesterol, hypothyroidism, hypertension, etc. The waiting period is 3 years, and the policy is priced on par with its peers, offering good value and extensive coverage.\nDrawbacks:\nWhile Aditya Birla has good\noperational metrics\nfor a new entrant, we feel they can improve their metrics in the near future.\nThings to Remember when Purchasing a Health Insurance Plan if you have Pre-Existing Diseases\nEven the best policies have some restrictions, and when considering a health insurance policy, here are some essential points to consider:\nNot all health insurance policies cover pre-existing diseases:\nHealth insurance policies have varying approaches to pre-existing diseases (PEDs). Some policies include PEDs but impose a waiting period on them, which means claims related to these conditions are not covered until after the\nwaiting period\n. And some other policies may have permanent\nexclusions\n, especially for severe conditions such as advanced heart disease or cancer. This means that while the policy will cover new illnesses, it will not cover treatment related to these excluded conditions. It’s important to read the policy documents carefully and understand the specific terms and conditions for PED coverage to avoid unpleasant surprises when making a claim.\nPre-existing diseases increase the cost of your premiums:\nInsurers consider pre-existing diseases a higher risk because they are more likely to result in claims. To offset this risk, insurers often increase the premiums for individuals with PEDs. This increase is usually in the form of a\nloading charge\n– an additional percentage added to the base premium. For example, if you have diabetes, the insurer might add a percentage of your base\npremium\nas a loading charge. Apart from this, insurers may also require a\nco-payment\n, where you must pay a certain percentage of the treatment cost out of pocket, with the insurer covering the rest. This co-payment can vary widely, from 10% to as much as 50%, depending on the severity of the condition and the insurer's policies.\nHealth Insurers may reject your policy based on the PED:\nThe severity and nature of pre-existing diseases also significantly impact the insurer’s decision to accept or reject an application for the policy. If the insurer deems the risk too high, they may reject the application outright. This is more common if you have severe or multiple pre-existing conditions, such as advanced heart disease, chronic kidney disease, or certain cancers. You should always disclose your complete medical history during the application, as nondisclosure can lead to policy cancellation or denial of\nclaims\nlater. Seeking advice from insurance advisors knowledgeable about which companies offer the best coverage for specific conditions can also be beneficial.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, we’ve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

Slots are running out, so make sure you\nbook a call now!\nConclusion\nChoosing the right insurance policy is quite taxing, more so if you have pre-existing diseases. You need to consider various factors such as loading charges, waiting periods, and whether or not the policy even covers your ailment after the waiting period. This is why choosing one of the top policies in 2024 can ensure that you get the best possible coverage.\nHowever, there’s no one-size-fits-all health insurance policy, so it’s always best to consult a trusted insurance advisor to find the best health insurance plan tailored to your needs.\nLast updated on\n22 August 2024"

So picking out the best health insurance plans can be challenging.\nThis is why we put together this list to help you shortlist the best\nhealth insurance policies\nin India for 2025.\nBest Health Insurance Plans in India 2025\nTop Health Plans\nInsurer Rating\nFeature Rating\nAffordability\nFinal Rating\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n4.5\n4.5\n3.5\n4.2\nCare Supreme\n3.5\n4.5\n4.8\n4\nNiva Bupa Reassure 2.0\n3.2\n4.8\n4.8\n3.8\nAditya Birla Activ Fit\n3.8\n3.5\n4.6\n3.8\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\n4\n3\n4\n3.8\nHeads Up:\nIt takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyse a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.

Book today!\nOur Methodology\nIf youâre new to insurance, we highly recommend you check out our\nHealth Insurance guide for beginners\n.\nNow, we compiled this list using two broad criteria.\nThe first one is our assessment of the insurance company marketing a given policy. Any company can float a health insurance plan whose\nfeatures\nlook amazing on paper. But if customers have trouble buying the policy, making a claim, or resolving issues, then ultimately the product features donât count for much. So weâve taken into consideration several operational and financial metrics, like claim settlement numbers, track record, and solvency ratios to rank every health insurance company in India.\nWe then took each product and\ncompared\ntheir features. Now bear in mind that most insurance companies will have a basic affordable product, a comprehensive product, and a premium product. The basic product doesnât offer a lot of protection. And the premium products are too expensive and have features that often donât add a lot of value for most people. So while compiling this list weâve only considered comprehensive products that offer significant protection while not burning a hole in your pocket.\nWith that introduction out of the way, letâs look at the top health insurance plans in a little more detail.\nBest Health Insurance Plans\n1\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure Health Insurance\nHDFC Ergo\nOptima Secure takes the top rank this year. It was introduced to replace the companyâs best-selling product -\nOptima Restore\n. In just 2 years since its launch, it has done just that â exceeding expectations from all corners and emerging as our top recommendation for the best health insurance plan for the year 2024.\nInsurer Rating\n4.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n3.5\nFinal Rating\n4.2\nWhy\nOptima Secure\nis our top recommendation\nOptima Secure is an extremely comprehensive policy. It has no room rent restrictions, no\nco-pay clause\n, covers\nAyush treatments\nand has reasonable\nwaiting periods\nfor\npre-existing diseases\n. It also has a bunch of industry-first features that will excite a lot of people.\nSecure Benefit:\nSecure benefit instantly doubles your cover the moment you buy the policy. So for instance, if you buy a a policy with a sum insured of â¹10 lakhs, you get the â¹10 lakhs as base cover and an additional â¹10 lakhs as âSecureâ benefit. Effectively you get double the cover without having to pay more.\nProtect Benefit:\nUsually, insurers donât cover non-medical expenses that could include things like bandages, syringes, gloves, and masks. Even if they do cover it, they ask you to pay extra. But Optima Secure covers these expenses at no additional cost.\nPlus Benefit:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, Optima Secure has completely remodeled the bonus feature and is now offering 50% bonus cover every year irrespective of whether you made a claim. The bonus could go as high as 100% if you renew your policy for 2 consecutive years.\nOn a stand-alone basis, these features may not mean much. But when you compare it against Optima Restore, youâll see why this is a huge leap.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

So if affordability is a concern, itâs best to look at other plans on this list.\n2\nCare Supreme Health Insurance\nCare\nSupreme is second on our list as it is now the best-selling health insurance policy within Careâs stable. The company launched this plan to compete against the likes of HDFC Ergoâs Optima Secure and Niva Bupaâs Reassure. And considering the features on board and the price point at which it sells, Care Supreme can be a very attractive option for a lot of people.\nInsurer Rating\n3.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n4\nWhy\nCare Supreme\nis No.2 on our list\nItâs a comprehensive plan, that offers pretty much every\nhealth insurance add-ons\nyou need, and it is perhaps one of the most affordable plans in this category. Some of the top features include:\nUnlimited Automatic Restoration\n:\nCare Supreme will automatically refill your cover every time you make a claim. So if you have a policy with a cover of â¹10 lakhs and you make a claim totalling â¹2 lakhs, it will restore your cover back to â¹10 lakhs the moment you make the claim.\nNo Bonus clawbacks:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, they will usually clawback a part of the bonus if you ever make a claim. Care Supreme however has no such clause and you will have your bonus intact even if you make multiple claims.\nAffordability:\nThis isnât a feature as much. But itâs still worth noting that the difference in price point between Care Supreme and other similar plans is substantial. For instance, Optima Secure (our top recommendation) is nearly 30% more expensive when compared to Care Supreme for the profiles listed below.\nPremium comparison\nOptima Secure\nCare Supreme\nMale 28, living in Bangalore\nâ¹12,892\nâ¹7,701\nFamily of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹24,418\nâ¹14,357\nCouple of an advanced age -\nMale 66, Female 63\nNA\nâ¹62,210\nRead our full comparison report of\nCare Supreme vs HDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThere is a 4-year waiting period for pre-existing diseases and the only way to cut this down is to buy separate add-ons. Thereâs also another insurer-specific reason why we arenât ranking this plan higher. The claim settlement and complaint numbers for Care arenât that amazing.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE!

Also, Reassure 2.0 builds on the success of Reassure by offering 3 variants of the same plan with extremely comprehensive features at very competitive price points. For the purpose of this list, we are considering the Platinum variant of Reassure 2.0 which sits right between the\nBronze\nvariant and the\nTitanium\nvariant.\nInsurer Rating\n3.2\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.8\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Reassure 2.0 is third on our list\nIt is one of the best policies in its class. It's economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits at a very attractive price point. Hereâs a select few features that we like:\nForever\nRestoration\n:\nYour cover is restored in full the moment you make a claim. And you will have the extra cover throughout your policy term. Also, the restored sum will be added on top of your existing cover and you can claim the full amount (what's left of your base cover and the restored sum) while making a claim.\nAge lock benefit:\nYour premiums will not increase until you make a claim. However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nCarry Forward Bonus:\nEvery year the policy will calculate the unutilized base cover and transfer it to the next year. So if you started with â¹10 lakhs and you made a claim totaling â¹2 lakhs, the remaining â¹8 lakhs will be added to your cover next year and you will have â¹18 lakhs (â¹10 lakhs base cover + â¹8 Lakhs unutilized base cover + bonus) for the next year.\nReassure\nReassure 2.0\nForever Restoration\nAge Lock Benefit\nCarry Forward Bonus\nPremiums for Family of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹21,306\nâ¹19,560\nRead our full comparison report of\nNiva Bupa ReAssure vs Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThereâs nothing to complain about the features. But there are a few issues with the insurer. After the change in management (Max Bupa to Niva Bupa), we have seen a general rise in the amount of complaints. Our own experience working with the insurer on the claim settlement process has left us a bit frustrated. So we canât possibly place them any higher despite the attractive price point and the industry-first features on hand.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE! Book a call now. Limited slots available.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\n4\nAditya Birla Activ Fit Health Insurance\nAditya Birla\nmakes our list at number 4 because most people we tend to fall between the ages of 18 and 45. And this policy is designed specifically for them. It offers significant discounts if youâre healthy, it has no outrageous restrictions, a very good restoration benefit, supercharged bonus feature and it sells at a very attractive price point.\nInsurer Rating\n3.8\nProduct Feature Rating\n3.5\nAffordability\n4.6\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Aditya Birla Activ Fit takes the 4th spot\nAs we noted already itâs a comprehensive policy and it offers some very nice benefits for people who keep healthy:\nUpfront good health discount:\nYou get an upfront 10% discount on your first policy premium by simply undergoing a successful health assessment.\n100% Binge Refill:\nYour cover will be restored in full every time you make a claim. It offers unlimited restoration.\nMaternity and OPD Coverage:\nYou also get some coverage for\nmaternity-related expenses\nand\noutpatient consultations\n. And while we donât usually recommend these features (since it can burn a hole in your pocket), Aditya Bira offers all of this and more without asking you to pay a bomb.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nWhile the product features are decent and the insurer does okay on most fronts, the maximum entry age for the product is capped at 45 years. So if youâre older than 45 you canât buy this policy, which could be frustrating for those who are above the ages of 45.\n5\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\nBajaj Allianz\nHealth Guard Gold makes our list at no 5. The plan does what you would expect from a comprehensive health policy. Itâs not very expensive. And Bajaj Allianz has been posting very respectable claim settlement numbers so far. All things considered, this is a solid plan from a solid company.\nInsurer Rating\n4\nProduct Feature Rating\n3\nAffordability\n4\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\ntakes the 5th spot\nAs we noted earlier, itâs important to look at product features. But itâs even more important to evaluate the insurer. And when we compare Bajaj Allianzâs claim settlement numbers over the last 3 years against other insurers on this list, you will see why this is one of our top 5 recommendations.\nClaim Settlement Ratios\nBajaj Allianz\nAditya Birla\nCare\nHDFC Ergo\nNiva Bupa\n2020-2021\n94.5%\n89.3%\n95.2%\n97%\n90.7%\n2021-2022\n90.8%\n93.7%\n87%\n100%\n90.8%\n2022-2023\n96.8%\n95.9%\n90%\n95.5%\n90.5%\n2023-2024\n95%\n95%\n90%\n98%\n91%\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nAll the other products that make our list offer significant protection by way of extending features like unlimited restoration, supercharged bonus features and unique benefits that you may not find anywhere else. The problem with Health Guard Gold is that it does what you expect it do, but there arenât any shiny features to boast of. So that should explain why we didnât place the plan higher on the list.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, weâve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

No spam, no cold calls - just a conversation for your customised policy!\nLimited slots! Book today!\nThere are 30 health insurance companies in India. 6 Stand-alone health insurers and 24 General Insurers.\nStandalone health insurance companies are insurance companies that only sell health policies and nothing else. In 2012, Star Health Insurance became the first institution to set up a standalone health insurance company in India. Since then, 5 other companies have gone down the same route. And together they market a lot of policies with a whole host of features and coverage.\nGeneral Health Insurance companies are those that dabble with health, motor, and other non-life policies. In this section, however, we will restrict the analysis to general health insurance companies that market at least one health insurance policy.\nDifference between Standalone health insurance companies and general insurance companies\nFrom a buyerâs perspective, there isnât a lot of difference when you compare health policies marketed by general insurance companies and standalone health insurers. For instance, you canât automatically assume that a standalone health insurer will offer a better experience since they specialize in this domain. In our experience, weâve seen general insurance companies do far better than standalone health insurance companies on several occasions. So that analysis is fraught with issues.\nHowever, it must be noted that a standalone health insurer will likely have a better suite of products for a wide audience base, whereas a general insurance company may not have as many products. So if youâre looking to buy a policy for a very specific use case youâd be better off picking a standalone health insurance company.\nNow that we have the basics sorted, letâs look at the next item.\nHow to\ncompare health insurance\ncompanies?\nWhen you are comparing different health insurance companies you have to rank them along a series of objective metrics before you take the final call. What do these metrics look like? Letâs start with the basics.\n1\nHistorical Track Record:\nImagine a company thatâs only been in business for a few odd months. Itâs almost impossible to assess if the insurer holds potential. So youâre likely taking a gamble when you pick a policy from their basket. However, if you have a company that already has an extensive track record, then you can build a comprehensive assessment.\nFor instance, a young company with only a track record of a couple of years could post stellar claim settlement numbers, and offer amazing customer service. But itâs entirely possible that these numbers may go for a toss as they scale their business. On the flip side, if you have an insurance company that has been in the business for a while posting consistent numbers, you could expect them to do similar figures going ahead. You also donât have to worry about potential issues that could crop up when they scale their business. So our suggestion is to always look at a companyâs track record before you zero in on an insurer.\nAnd if you have trouble doing this yourself, hereâs a list of the top 5 insurance companies in India with the longest track record.\nCompany\nTrack Record\nNational Insurance\n118 years\nNew India Assurance\n105 years\nUnited Insurance\n86 years\nOriental Insurance\n77 years\nIFFCO Tokio\n24 years\nIf you look at the table above, you will see a peculiar pattern. All these companies are state-run, because the insurance sector in India was only privatized in 2000. Meaning most private companies have a track record of less than 24 years. However, any company with a track record of 10 years or greater would be a good bet. A company with a track record of 5 years and above is decent. And we generally urge people to avoid any company with a track record of less than 5 years.\n2\nOperational proficiency:\nBased on the ranking above, youâd think that state-run companies are a better bet, considering their extensive track record. But the truth is that state-run companies usually have a bad reputation within the industry. Theyâre very slow in processing applications. Itâs extremely hard to get a hold of customer care executives in these large public enterprises. And the claim settlement process is laborious. So you could argue that the table above is meaningless unless you take into account other metricsâlike operations efficiencies.\nBut what do we really mean when we say operational proficiency? Well, operational proficiency deals with the end-to-end processâright from filling out the application to making the claim. If an insurer offers a smooth journey throughout, then you could argue that theyâre operationally robust. On the other hand, if you see customer complaints, poor response time and sub-par claim settlement processes, itâs safe to say that they wonât rank well on operational efficiency.\nAnd as a general rule of thumb, private insurers do better than state-run insurers in this department.\nBut even amongst private insurers, you have some who are more in tune with their customers and others who donât care as much. Once again, itâs not easy to tell them apart. But you could scour the web for some data points. Youâll find information on customer complaints, performance surveys, social media acceptance online. And you may have to put them all together to form an opinion. On the flip side, you could also talk to insurance experts, like our\nadvisors at Ditto\nand take our help in this matter.\n3\nProduct Portfolio:\nProduct portfolio matters if you are looking to buy policies for a specific use case. For instance, some companies offer products for a wide range of use cases. They offer affordable policies with bare minimum features, they offer comprehensive policies with a whole host of must-have features and premium policies that cover everythingâ right from dental complications to maternity expenses. Even others offer policies for special use cases i.e. senior citizens, cancer patients, diabetics and those with serious health complications.\nSo here we will list down companies who have an extensive product portfolio\nCompany\nAffordable Option\nComprehensive Options\nPremium Options\nDiabetic Specific policy\nCancer Specific policy\nHeart Specific policy\nSenior Citizen Options\nHDFC Ergo\nNone\nOptima Secure\n,\nOptima Super Secure\n,\nOptima Restore\nOptima Secure Global\n,\nOptima Secure Global Plus\n,\nHealth Wallet\nEnergy Silver\n,\nEnergy Gold\nNone\nNone\nOptime Secure\nCare\nCare Advantage\nCare Supreme\n,\nCare Plus\nNone\nNone\nCare Freedom\nCare Heart\nCare Supreme\nAditya Birla\nActiv One NXT\nActiv One MAX\n,\nActiv Fit\nActiv One MAX+\n,\nActiv One VIP\n,\nActiv One VIP+\nActiv One MAX\n,\nActiv One NXT\nNone\nNone\nActiv One MAX\n,\nActiv One NXT\nNiva Bupa\nReAssure 2.0\nReAssure 2.0\n,\nAspire\nHealth Premia\n,\nHeartbeat\nNone\nNone\nNone\nSenior First\n,\nHealth Companion\nBajaj Allianz\nHealth Guard Silver\n,\nHealth Ensure Family\nHealth Guard Gold\n,\nPlatinum\nHealth Care Supreme\nNone\nNone\nNone\nSilver Health\nThe above table was last updated on 23rd September 2024\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nWe only want whatâs best for YOU.

Meaning if you ever visited a network hospital, then youâd technically be able to make a claim without paying a single penny out of pocket. On the other hand, if you were hospitalized in a non-network institution, then youâd have to pay the bills yourself and wait for reimbursement. Which once again, can be a painstaking process. So clearly, being admitted to a network hospital can save you a lot of time and money.\nHowever, not every company partners with every hospital out there. Some companies have partnered with over 10,000 hospitals. Even others have less than a few thousand hospitals on their platform.\nIn our experience, any insurer with a hospital network spanning 8000+ hospitals is a decent bet. Anything between 5,000 and 8,000 is okay. And less than 5,000 is a no-no.\nWith that said, hereâs a list of the top 10 insurers with the largest hospital network.\nCompany\nNetwork Hospitals\nDigit\n16,400+\nCare\n11,400+\nStar Health\n14,000+\nNavi\n12,000+\nHDFC Ergo\n13,000+\nAditya Birla\n12,000+\nAcko\n10,000+\nNiva Bupa (erstwhile Max Bupa)\n10,000+\nTATA AIG\n11,000+\nRoyal Sundaram\n10,000+\n5\nClaim Settlement Ratio:\nClaim settlement ratio\ntells you about the percentage of claims settled by an insurer during a specified period. Put another way, a claim settlement ratio of 90 tells you that the insurance company settled 90 claims for every 100 claims they book during the year.\nThe figure is calculated using the formula: Claims settled / (Claims booked + Claims outstanding at the beginning â Claims outstanding at the end)\nIn our opinion, a claim settlement ratio of 90% and above is stellar. A claim settlement ratio of 80-90% is decent. And anything less than 80% is a no-go.\nHereâs a list of companies with the highest claim settlement ratios for average of FY2021-2024\nCompany\nCLAIM SETTLEMENT RATIO\n(avg. of last 3 years)\nNew India Assurance\n99\n%\nHDFC Ergo\n98\n%\nSBI\n97\n%\nDigit\n97\n%\nOriental Insurance\n96\n%\nTATA AIG\n96\n%\nAcko\n96\n%\nIffco Tokio\n95\n%\nAditya Birla\n95\n%\nUniversal Sompo\n95\n%\nBajaj Allianz\n95\n%\nUnited India\n94\n%\nRoyal Sundaram\n94\n%\nNational Insurance\n93\n%\nZuno (erstwhile Edelweiss)\n92\n%\nNiva Bupa (erstwhile Max Bupa)\n91\n%\nManipal Cigna\n90\n%\nCare\n90\n%\nReliance\n89\n%\nICICI Lombard\n85\n%\nBharti Axa\n85\n%\nStar Health\n83\n%\nNavi\n64\n%\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, weâve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

And despite not having the most extensive track record, they have managed to market products that are truly affordable.\nThey also have a claim settlement ratio of 96% alongside 10,000+ network hospitals and they are brimming with potential.\nApollo Munich (now HDFC ERGO)\nFounded in the year 2002, the company is a joint venture between Indiaâs HDFC and Germanyâs ERGO International AG. It offers policies across motor, travel, health and other sectors. And it also happens to be one of the largest insurers in the country.\nMore importantly, HDFC Ergo boasts a claim settlement ratio of 98%, with a network of 13,000+ hospitals\nAll in all, an impressive resume.\nBharti Axa\nBharti Axa is a joint venture set up by Bharti Enterprises and Axa Health (UKâs leading Health Insurance Company). The company started its operations in 2005 and after being acquired by ICICI Lombard in 2021, they are now one of the largest leading online insurance companies in India.\nHaving said that, however, the company boasts a measly claim settlement ratio of about 85% and only has a sparse network of 4,500 hospitals PAN India. Not exactly stellar.\nDigit\nDigit Insurance is a 4-year-old InsurTech start-up financed by the Fairfax Group, a prominent Financial Services company. And despite not having the most extensive track record, they have managed to market products that are truly affordable.\nThey also have a claim settlement ratio of 97% alongside 16,400+ network hospitals and they are brimming with potential.\nICICI Lombard\nICICI Lombard Health Insurance company is a joint venture between India's ICICI Bank and Canada's Fairfax Holdings. They are one of the leading insurance companies with over 270 branches spread across India.\nHowever, with a claim settlement ratio of 85% and a measly network of 10,200+ hospitals, their performance needs significant improvement.\nManipal Cigna\nManipalCigna Health Insurance Company is a collaborative partnership between Manipal Group and Cigna and together they have over 200 years of expertise in the healthcare business. And while the company has shown some potential recently, it still only corners a small part of the Indian market.\nAlso, they have a settlement ratio of 90% with more than 8,500+ network hospitals in tow.\nNational Insurance\nNational Insurance is the country's oldest general insurance firm and is wholly owned by the Government of India. That means, despite a claim settlement ratio of 93% and over 3,200 network hospitals it can be a bit difficult to reach the insurer when you need them the most. Perhaps due to the fact that they are still a public sector enterprise.\nNew India Assurance\nNew India Assurance, is a government-owned insurance firm that was established in 1919. Their insurance portfolio includes Health, Motor, Travel, and Marine products. But despite being in the business for so long, theyâre not the most efficient when it comes to processing your application and dealing with your claims.\nAnd that means, even with a relatively high claim settlement ratio and 3,700+ network hospitals, the company isnât exactly a stellar performer.\nReliance\nReliance General Insurance, part of the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, entered the health insurance industry in 2000 but has not gained significant market share over the past two decades.\nThey also have a claim settlement ratio of 89% alongside 10,000+ network hospitals.\nSBI\nSBI General Insurance Company Limited is a joint venture between the State Bank of India and Insurance Australia Group (IAG). The firm, which was founded in 2008, offers insurance products in the areas of auto, travel, home, and health.\nHowever considering they are a part of Indiaâs largest government-owned banking firm, you can expect a bit of dilly-dallying during the claims process. And their claim settlement ratio of 97% isnât something to boast of either.\nTATA AIG\nTata AIG Health Insurance company is a joint venture between the Tata Group and American International Group. It was founded in 2001 and itâs one of the few companies that market products that are truly comprehensive, albeit expensive.\nThe company also boasts a claim settlement ratio of 96% with over 11,000 network hospitals across India.\nUniversal Sompo\nUniversal Sompo General Insurance Company is a public-private venture floated by two nationalized banks (Indian Overseas Bank and Allahabad Bank), one private bank (Karnataka Bank), an FMCG giant (Dabur Investment Corporation), and a well-known Japanese insurance firm (Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance Incorporation).\nThe insurer also sells 135 IRDAI approved products and boasts over 5,000 network hospitals with a claim setllement ratio of 95%. Needless to say, the company isnât exactly stellar when it comes to processing claims.\nAditya Birla\nAditya Birla started operations in the year 2016 as a subsidiary of Aditya Birla Capital Ltd., which in turn happens to be a joint venture between the famed Aditya Birla Group and MMI Holdings (South Africa).\nThe company holds a claim settlement ratio of 95% along with a network of more than 12,000+ hospitals, and extremely interesting products for young people with a focus on fitness. And considering their track record has been improving rapidly they are emerging as a top health insurer in the market.\nBajaj Allianz\nFounded in 2001, the company is a joint venture between Bajaj Finserv Limited (of the Bajaj Group) and Allianz SE, a German financial services corporation.\nAnd while they may not be the biggest insurer out there, they do have a claim settlement ratio of 95%, with a network of more than 12,000 hospitals.\nCare\nCare Health Insurance (formerly Religare Health Insurance) was founded in 2012. And in that time, theyâve managed to corner a large part of the Indian Insurance market.\nWhatâs more impressive?\nCare Health Insurance has a remarkable claim settlement ratio of 90% and a network of more than 11,400+ hospitals.\nHDFC Ergo\nFounded in the year 2002, the company is a joint venture between Indiaâs HDFC and Germanyâs ERGO International AG. It offers policies across motor, travel, health and other sectors. And it also happens to be one of the largest insurers in the country.\nMore importantly, HDFC Ergo boasts a claim settlement ratio of 98%, with a network of 13,000+ hospitals\nAll in all, an impressive resume.\nIffco Tokio\nIffco Tokio is a joint venture between Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO), a government-owned fertilizer company, and Japan-based Tokio Marine Group. They have a sizable presence in many rural markets, however, their presence in urban areas isn't exactly extraordinary.\nThe company has a network of over 7,900 hospitals and its CSR ratio isnât useful, since they have been settling a lot of pending claims from last year.\nNiva Bupa (erstwhile Max Bupa)\nFounded in 2008, Niva Bupa (erstwhile Max Bupa) is one of the leading health insurance companies in India. While they have had a bit of a tumultuous time with their promoters, they still sell an impressive suite of products across multiple categories.\nAnd they also boast a claim settlement ratio of 91%, with a network of more than 10,000+ hospitals.\nNavi\nNavi Insurance is an emerging general insurance company that started its operations in November 2017. Although it has remained active for only 4 years, it offers a whole host of insurance products like Health, Motor, Travel, and Home Insurance. Under Health, it offers a single policy with benefits like Maternity and Health check-ups.\nOriental Insurance\nOriental Insurance is a government-owned company that offers health, vehicle, business, and farmer insurance. The company is a fully-owned component of the Oriental Government Security Life Assurance Company Ltd.\nNow because it is a government-owned insurance firm, you canât expect operational efficiencies across the board. Although, the company does boast a fairly high claim settlement ratio with over 4,000+ network hospitals across the country.\nRoyal Sundaram\nFounded in 2001, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Limited was India's maiden private sector general insurance company. The insurer is a forerunner in the bancassurance department, extending deep ties with reputable banks and Non-Banking Finance Companies across the country.\nThey also have a claim settlement ratio of 94% and 10,000+ network hospitals dotted across the country.\nStar Health\nStar Health Insurance is India's first standalone health insurance firm. And with an army of retail advisors pushing their products across the country, theyâve managed to capture a fair share of the Indian market.\nThe company also boasts a network of over 14,000+ hospitals and a decent claim settlement ratio of 83%.\nUnited India\nUnited India General Insurance company is an amalgamation of 22 different entities. The insurer has played an integral part in underwriting numerous government insurance schemes like - Maharashtra Governmentâs Mahathma Jyothiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana Health Insurance Scheme (2020) & Prime Minister Suraksha Bima Yojana.\nHowever, since it is a government-owned insurance firm, itâs not the most nimble insurance company out there.\nZuno (erstwhile Edelweiss)\nZuno (erstwhile Edelweiss) Health Insurance company was founded in 2017 when they were hived off the homegrown Edelweiss Financial Services Limited. The company provides an array of products across multiple categories and they boast a claim settlement ratio of almost 92% with more than 6,200 network hospitals.\nThe only problem is - Theyâre still trying to find a firm foothold in the market.\nFAQs about Health Insurance Companies:\n1\n.\nHow many Health Insurance companies are there in India?\nIndia has 30 health insurance companies. Of these, 24 are general insurance providers and the rest 6 are standalone health insurance companies.\n2\n.\nCan I port my policy from one Health Insurance company to another one?\nYes, you can.\nMedical inflation and COVID-19 have led to the growing necessity and reliance on financial coverage options for healthcare expenses. Subsequently, now the insurance market has more players with diverse and lucrative offers and perks in the coverage plans.\nTo ensure that policyholders have the option to avail the most suitable policy cover, the IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority) enabled the portability option in 2011.\nHowever, before you opt for the portability option, itâs crucial that you understand the why, the how, and the when! Hereâs a detailed article that will be your perfect guide!\n3\n.\nWhich are the best Health Insurance companies on the basis of Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR)?\nA higher CSR of a health insurance provider is indicative of the companyâs claim settlement ability and history.

    "title": "What is Co-Payment in Health Insurance?",
    "text": "23 December 2022\n•\nHealth Insurance\nWhat is Co-Payment in Health Insurance?\nTable of Contents\nIt’s been 6 months since you last met your best friend. One day, you both meet for a short reunion at your favourite restaurant. After a rejuvenating few hours of laughter and stories, you wrap up the party.\nThe bill arrives - it’s ₹4k, and you decide to GO DUTCH and split the bill 2 ways - ₹2k each. Then, you hug, promise to meet each other soon, and part ways.\nWell,\nco-payment in health insurance\nis similar - GOING DUTCH ON YOUR MEDICAL BILL. The only difference is it’s between the insurer and you (the insured), and the split isn’t 50-50. Depending on your insurance provider and their co-payment clauses, it may be 90-10, 80-20, or 70-30.\nBut why are policyholders even considering co-payment clauses? When should you avail of policies that come with such a feature? Read on to learn more about this!\nWhat is co-payment in health insurance?\nLet’s put it this way: Co-payment is a feature in\nhealth insurance\nwherein the policyholder agrees to pay a percentage of the hospital bill with the insurer. If you agree to a 20% co-payment clause, you need to pay 20% of the hospital bill when you eventually make a claim.\nYou’re probably wondering now – If I can avail myself of a\nreimbursement\nof 100% of the hospital bill, why would I opt for a co-payment?\nWell, here’s the thing — if you opt for co-payment, your insurance premium will also be reduced by a similar proportion. This is one of the main reasons people are tempted to opt for copayment.\nHowever, co-payment is mandatory in some situations, such as for people with\npre-existing diseases\nor\nsenior citizen\ns. Most likely, if you belong to one of these groups, you would not be eligible for a\nhealth insurance policy\nat all. However, with co-payment, you may be eligible to purchase certain policies. Apart from this, co-payment might be imposed by insurers for two other reasons:\nLocation-related Co-payment:\nInsurers may impose co-payment clauses based on the 'Zone' where you avail treatment. Healthcare costs can vary significantly from one zone (location) to another. Suppose you purchase the policy in lower-tier cities (Zone 2 or Zone 3) but frequently avail hospitalisation in cities like Mumbai or Delhi, usually in Zone 1. In that case, the insurer may inform you to co-pay from the next time or cancel your policy.\nHospital-related Co-payment:\nSometimes, co-payment is tied to the type of hospital where you avail treatment. Insurers may impose a co-payment if the policyholder opts for treatment in hospitals not listed in the insurer's network. To encourage the use of\nnetwork hospitals\nwhere the insurer has negotiated rates, the insurer may apply a co-payment clause for non-network hospitals.\nHeads Up: It takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyze a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.\nThis is why we propose a better alternative - taking a 30-minute FREE consultation with Ditto’s certified advisors. We have a spam-free guarantee, and we’ll never push you to buy a plan. Don’t delay this - we have limited slots every day, so\nbook a quick call here\nbefore they run out.\nHow does co-payment affect health insurance premiums and payouts?\nThe insurer discounts your premium, but you must pay a portion of the bill when you eventually make a claim. The higher the co-payment %, the lower the premium.\nLet’s understand this with an example:\nThere is a pair of twins named Thyrabeth and Lizbeth. They have always had very similar preferences right from a young age. Now that they’re older, they decide to\npurchase a health insurance policy\n.\nAs usual, they agree upon the same policy offered by a\ntop health insurer in India\n.\nBut there’s one key difference here —Thyrabeth opts for the policy without copayment, but Lizbeth purchases the policy with a 20% copayment. How does this affect their premiums?\nThyrabeth pays a premium of ₹10k per annum, and Lizbeth pays a premium of ₹8k per annum. But, while making a claim, here’s how it will pan out:\nParticulars\nThyrabeth (Without Copayment)\nLizbeth (With Copayment)\nPremium Paid\n₹10k\n₹8k\nHospital Bill\n₹2 lakhs\n₹2 lakh\nCopayment\nN/A\n20% copayment\nInsurance Claim\n₹2 lakhs\n₹1.6 lakhs\nOut-of-Pocket Expenses\n₹0\n₹40k\nAs you can see, Lizbeth saved ₹2k by opting for co-payment, but while making a claim, she lost ₹40k. In the long run, not opting for co-payment is the better choice.\nHowever, not everyone has this choice. If you fall into specific categories, co-payment will become mandatory (depending on the policy).\nWhy is co-payment imposed in health insurance plans?\nCo-payment is a way for insurance companies to share medical expenses with you, the policyholder. It is optional in most cases. But, if you fall into one of these buckets, there’s a good chance co-payment would be mandatory –\nHave Pre-Existing Diseases (PEDs):\nPeople with multiple PEDs usually require continuous treatment and frequent hospitalisations. If you have pre-existing diseases, insurers often impose a co-payment clause to mitigate this risk.\nSenior Citizens\n:\nOlder people are more likely to have health issues that need constant medical attention. This only increases the probability of hospital visits, treatments, and medical procedures. To manage this increased risk, insurers often add a co-payment clause to senior citizens’ policies or if you are purchasing a policy after a certain age.\nShould you purchase a health insurance policy with a co-payment?\nSuppose you fall into one of the above categories. In that case, co-payment allows you to access necessary medical treatments and hospitalisations while sharing the costs with the insurer, which can be more beneficial than not having a health insurance policy at all.\nBut if you don’t fall into one of the above categories, it would be best to avoid co-payment. Think about it – While you may save money in the short term, you lose out over a more extended period when making a claim.\nCTA\nWhat are the best health insurance policies with co-payment?\nHDFC ERGO Energy (Optional Co-Payment):\nAlthough others can purchase it, HDFC ERGO Energy is a policy specifically designed for people with diabetes and hypertension. You can choose a sum insured from ₹2 lahks to ₹50 lakhs, with an optional co-payment clause (if you would like to reduce your premiums).\nCare Advantage (Optional/Mandatory Co-Payment):\nCare Advantage is one of the few policies you can enroll in until you’re 100 years old. However, there is a mandatory 20% co-payment if you’re over 61.  You can choose a cover amount starting at ₹25 lakhs all the way up to ₹6 crores (one of the highest in the industry!) at an affordable premium. Care also offers various riders and add-ons that you can take advantage of and customise the policy as per your needs.\nAditya Birla Activ Health Platinum (Zonal & Optional Co-Payment):\nActiv Health Platinum has two variants, Essential and Enhanced, and both have copayments that depend on the sum insured and the zone in which you’re buying the policy. It has a 10%-25% copayment if you purchase the policy in a lower zone and avail of treatment in a higher zone. The Essential variant has a 10% co-payment for non-network hospitals. However, the Enhanced Variant does not have this additional clause. If you have the Enhanced variant, the insurer also does not impose the co-payment in case of accidents.\nNiva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n(Optional Co-Payment):\nAs one of Niva Bupa's top policies, this one has all the bells and whistles you need. It has no room rent restriction and disease-wise sub-limits but has an optional co-payment clause. You can choose the co-payment percentage as per your needs. However, there’s a benefit: co-payment will not be applicable for annual health checkups, second opinion, Personal Accident Rider, etc.\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold (Zonal Co-Payment):\nWhile Bajaj Allianz offers a discount of up to 30% if you’re purchasing the policy in Zone 2 and 3, they also impose a co-payment if you’re availing of treatment in a higher zone, which ranges from 5% to 20%.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your\nHealth\nInsurance?\nAt Ditto, we’ve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

Slots are running out, so make sure you\nbook a call now!\nConclusion\nWhile co-payment can help reduce your insurance premium, it also means you must pay a portion of the medical expenses during a claim. Co-payment is not recommended in most cases, but it is often unavoidable for people with PEDs or of an advanced age to purchase a health insurance policy without this feature. Either way, always\nconsult an IRDAI-Certified Insurance Advisor\nto make an informed decision about purchasing a health insurance policy.\nLast updated on\n9 August 2024"

So picking out the best health insurance plans can be challenging.\nThis is why we put together this list to help you shortlist the best\nhealth insurance policies\nin India for 2025.\nBest Health Insurance Plans in India 2025\nTop Health Plans\nInsurer Rating\nFeature Rating\nAffordability\nFinal Rating\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n4.5\n4.5\n3.5\n4.2\nCare Supreme\n3.5\n4.5\n4.8\n4\nNiva Bupa Reassure 2.0\n3.2\n4.8\n4.8\n3.8\nAditya Birla Activ Fit\n3.8\n3.5\n4.6\n3.8\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\n4\n3\n4\n3.8\nHeads Up:\nIt takes an average person up to 5 hours to read & analyse a policy, and 10 hours or more to compare different plans and make a decision.

Book today!\nOur Methodology\nIf youâre new to insurance, we highly recommend you check out our\nHealth Insurance guide for beginners\n.\nNow, we compiled this list using two broad criteria.\nThe first one is our assessment of the insurance company marketing a given policy. Any company can float a health insurance plan whose\nfeatures\nlook amazing on paper. But if customers have trouble buying the policy, making a claim, or resolving issues, then ultimately the product features donât count for much. So weâve taken into consideration several operational and financial metrics, like claim settlement numbers, track record, and solvency ratios to rank every health insurance company in India.\nWe then took each product and\ncompared\ntheir features. Now bear in mind that most insurance companies will have a basic affordable product, a comprehensive product, and a premium product. The basic product doesnât offer a lot of protection. And the premium products are too expensive and have features that often donât add a lot of value for most people. So while compiling this list weâve only considered comprehensive products that offer significant protection while not burning a hole in your pocket.\nWith that introduction out of the way, letâs look at the top health insurance plans in a little more detail.\nBest Health Insurance Plans\n1\nHDFC Ergo Optima Secure Health Insurance\nHDFC Ergo\nOptima Secure takes the top rank this year. It was introduced to replace the companyâs best-selling product -\nOptima Restore\n. In just 2 years since its launch, it has done just that â exceeding expectations from all corners and emerging as our top recommendation for the best health insurance plan for the year 2024.\nInsurer Rating\n4.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n3.5\nFinal Rating\n4.2\nWhy\nOptima Secure\nis our top recommendation\nOptima Secure is an extremely comprehensive policy. It has no room rent restrictions, no\nco-pay clause\n, covers\nAyush treatments\nand has reasonable\nwaiting periods\nfor\npre-existing diseases\n. It also has a bunch of industry-first features that will excite a lot of people.\nSecure Benefit:\nSecure benefit instantly doubles your cover the moment you buy the policy. So for instance, if you buy a a policy with a sum insured of â¹10 lakhs, you get the â¹10 lakhs as base cover and an additional â¹10 lakhs as âSecureâ benefit. Effectively you get double the cover without having to pay more.\nProtect Benefit:\nUsually, insurers donât cover non-medical expenses that could include things like bandages, syringes, gloves, and masks. Even if they do cover it, they ask you to pay extra. But Optima Secure covers these expenses at no additional cost.\nPlus Benefit:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, Optima Secure has completely remodeled the bonus feature and is now offering 50% bonus cover every year irrespective of whether you made a claim. The bonus could go as high as 100% if you renew your policy for 2 consecutive years.\nOn a stand-alone basis, these features may not mean much. But when you compare it against Optima Restore, youâll see why this is a huge leap.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier.

So if affordability is a concern, itâs best to look at other plans on this list.\n2\nCare Supreme Health Insurance\nCare\nSupreme is second on our list as it is now the best-selling health insurance policy within Careâs stable. The company launched this plan to compete against the likes of HDFC Ergoâs Optima Secure and Niva Bupaâs Reassure. And considering the features on board and the price point at which it sells, Care Supreme can be a very attractive option for a lot of people.\nInsurer Rating\n3.5\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.5\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n4\nWhy\nCare Supreme\nis No.2 on our list\nItâs a comprehensive plan, that offers pretty much every\nhealth insurance add-ons\nyou need, and it is perhaps one of the most affordable plans in this category. Some of the top features include:\nUnlimited Automatic Restoration\n:\nCare Supreme will automatically refill your cover every time you make a claim. So if you have a policy with a cover of â¹10 lakhs and you make a claim totalling â¹2 lakhs, it will restore your cover back to â¹10 lakhs the moment you make the claim.\nNo Bonus clawbacks:\nUsually insurance companies will offer you a bonus if you donât make a claim any given year. However, they will usually clawback a part of the bonus if you ever make a claim. Care Supreme however has no such clause and you will have your bonus intact even if you make multiple claims.\nAffordability:\nThis isnât a feature as much. But itâs still worth noting that the difference in price point between Care Supreme and other similar plans is substantial. For instance, Optima Secure (our top recommendation) is nearly 30% more expensive when compared to Care Supreme for the profiles listed below.\nPremium comparison\nOptima Secure\nCare Supreme\nMale 28, living in Bangalore\nâ¹12,892\nâ¹7,701\nFamily of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹24,418\nâ¹14,357\nCouple of an advanced age -\nMale 66, Female 63\nNA\nâ¹62,210\nRead our full comparison report of\nCare Supreme vs HDFC Ergo Optima Secure\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThere is a 4-year waiting period for pre-existing diseases and the only way to cut this down is to buy separate add-ons. Thereâs also another insurer-specific reason why we arenât ranking this plan higher. The claim settlement and complaint numbers for Care arenât that amazing.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE!

Also, Reassure 2.0 builds on the success of Reassure by offering 3 variants of the same plan with extremely comprehensive features at very competitive price points. For the purpose of this list, we are considering the Platinum variant of Reassure 2.0 which sits right between the\nBronze\nvariant and the\nTitanium\nvariant.\nInsurer Rating\n3.2\nProduct Feature Rating\n4.8\nAffordability\n4.8\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Reassure 2.0 is third on our list\nIt is one of the best policies in its class. It's economical. It covers most bases. It doesn't have outrageous conditions. And it offers a whole host of benefits at a very attractive price point. Hereâs a select few features that we like:\nForever\nRestoration\n:\nYour cover is restored in full the moment you make a claim. And you will have the extra cover throughout your policy term. Also, the restored sum will be added on top of your existing cover and you can claim the full amount (what's left of your base cover and the restored sum) while making a claim.\nAge lock benefit:\nYour premiums will not increase until you make a claim. However, once the claim is made, the premiums will increase based on age, inflation etc.\nCarry Forward Bonus:\nEvery year the policy will calculate the unutilized base cover and transfer it to the next year. So if you started with â¹10 lakhs and you made a claim totaling â¹2 lakhs, the remaining â¹8 lakhs will be added to your cover next year and you will have â¹18 lakhs (â¹10 lakhs base cover + â¹8 Lakhs unutilized base cover + bonus) for the next year.\nReassure\nReassure 2.0\nForever Restoration\nAge Lock Benefit\nCarry Forward Bonus\nPremiums for Family of three -\nMale 37, Female 29, Child 6\nâ¹21,306\nâ¹19,560\nRead our full comparison report of\nNiva Bupa ReAssure vs Niva Bupa ReAssure 2.0\n.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nThereâs nothing to complain about the features. But there are a few issues with the insurer. After the change in management (Max Bupa to Niva Bupa), we have seen a general rise in the amount of complaints. Our own experience working with the insurer on the claim settlement process has left us a bit frustrated. So we canât possibly place them any higher despite the attractive price point and the industry-first features on hand.\nTalk to IRDAI-certified experts\nHealth is tricky, and insurance trickier. But weâll simplify it for you - for FREE! Book a call now. Limited slots available.\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\nFind a time to talk\nWhatsApp us\n4\nAditya Birla Activ Fit Health Insurance\nAditya Birla\nmakes our list at number 4 because most people we tend to fall between the ages of 18 and 45. And this policy is designed specifically for them. It offers significant discounts if youâre healthy, it has no outrageous restrictions, a very good restoration benefit, supercharged bonus feature and it sells at a very attractive price point.\nInsurer Rating\n3.8\nProduct Feature Rating\n3.5\nAffordability\n4.6\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy Aditya Birla Activ Fit takes the 4th spot\nAs we noted already itâs a comprehensive policy and it offers some very nice benefits for people who keep healthy:\nUpfront good health discount:\nYou get an upfront 10% discount on your first policy premium by simply undergoing a successful health assessment.\n100% Binge Refill:\nYour cover will be restored in full every time you make a claim. It offers unlimited restoration.\nMaternity and OPD Coverage:\nYou also get some coverage for\nmaternity-related expenses\nand\noutpatient consultations\n. And while we donât usually recommend these features (since it can burn a hole in your pocket), Aditya Bira offers all of this and more without asking you to pay a bomb.\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nWhile the product features are decent and the insurer does okay on most fronts, the maximum entry age for the product is capped at 45 years. So if youâre older than 45 you canât buy this policy, which could be frustrating for those who are above the ages of 45.\n5\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\nBajaj Allianz\nHealth Guard Gold makes our list at no 5. The plan does what you would expect from a comprehensive health policy. Itâs not very expensive. And Bajaj Allianz has been posting very respectable claim settlement numbers so far. All things considered, this is a solid plan from a solid company.\nInsurer Rating\n4\nProduct Feature Rating\n3\nAffordability\n4\nFinal Rating\n3.8\nWhy\nBajaj Allianz Health Guard Gold\ntakes the 5th spot\nAs we noted earlier, itâs important to look at product features. But itâs even more important to evaluate the insurer. And when we compare Bajaj Allianzâs claim settlement numbers over the last 3 years against other insurers on this list, you will see why this is one of our top 5 recommendations.\nClaim Settlement Ratios\nBajaj Allianz\nAditya Birla\nCare\nHDFC Ergo\nNiva Bupa\n2020-2021\n94.5%\n89.3%\n95.2%\n97%\n90.7%\n2021-2022\n90.8%\n93.7%\n87%\n100%\n90.8%\n2022-2023\n96.8%\n95.9%\n90%\n95.5%\n90.5%\n2023-2024\n95%\n95%\n90%\n98%\n91%\nDrawbacks to Consider:\nAll the other products that make our list offer significant protection by way of extending features like unlimited restoration, supercharged bonus features and unique benefits that you may not find anywhere else. The problem with Health Guard Gold is that it does what you expect it do, but there arenât any shiny features to boast of. So that should explain why we didnât place the plan higher on the list.\nWhy Talk to Ditto for Your Health Insurance?\nAt Ditto, weâve assisted over 3,00,000 customers with choosing the right insurance policy.

This includes the cost of medication by the way.\nLearn More\nSpecial Bonus for being healthy and not claiming insurance\nYour sum insured increases by 50% each year, so long as you make no claims during this period.

Also, the bonus amount will reduce at same rate each time you make a claim. But hey, it's still a bonus.\nLearn More\nFull coverage even if you are forced to hospitalize at home\nThe insurer will bear the costs even if you are hospitalized at home due to a condition or the hospital running out of beds.
